## Introduction

Quarto is a scientific and technical markdown publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). In addition to the core capabilities of Pandoc, Quarto includes:

1.  Support for embedding output from Python, R, and Julia via integration with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) .

2.  A variety of extensions to Pandoc markdown useful for technical writing including callouts (admonitions), cross-references, sub-figures, layout panels, hover-able citations and footnotes, and more.

3.  A project system for rendering groups of documents at once, sharing options across documents, and producing aggregate output like [books](book-basics.md) and [websites](websites/website-basics.md).

4.  HTML output based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (including support for [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) themes).

5.  Automatic installation of required LaTeX packages when rendering PDF output.

The overall design of Quarto is influenced heavily by [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), however unlike R Markdown the architecture is language agnostic. In it's current iteration, Quarto can render plain markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, and Knitr (Rmd) documents..

## Hello, Quarto

Here's a simple example of a markdown document that includes a cross-referenced figure generated by [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/):

```` {.default}

## Polar Axis

For a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.

```{python}`r ''`
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig.cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
````

You can render this markdown document with Quarto using the following command:

``` {.bash}
$ quarto render matplotlib-demo.md
```

Embedded code blocks (in this case some Python code that generates a plot) are run by Quarto, and their output is included in the final document rendered by Pandoc. Here's what the document looks like:

![](docs/getting-started/images/hello-quarto.png){.border}

Don't worry if all the mechanics of this example aren't obvious, the main takeaway is that Quarto enables you to enhance [Pandoc markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) documents with features useful for scientific and technical communication including executable code, cross-references, and much more.

::: {.callout-note}
While this example demonstrates rendering an ordinary markdown file, Quarto can also be used just the same with other input formats like Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) and R Markdown documents (.Rmd).

## Installation

You can install the Quarto CLI (command-line interface) from here:

<https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/latest>

You can verify that Quarto has been installed correctly with:

``` {.bash}
$ quarto help
```

To install the development version of the Quarto CLI, git clone this repo then run the configure script for your platform (`configure-linux.sh`, `configure-macos.sh`, or `configure-window.cmd`). For example:

``` {.bash}
$ git clone https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli
$ cd quarto-cli
$ ./configure-macos.sh
```
