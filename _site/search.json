You should generally be able to use Quarto to render any existing Rmd document without changes.\nOne important difference between R Markdown documents and Quarto documents is that in Quarto chunk options are typically included in special comments at the top of code chunks rather than within the line that begins the chunk. For example:\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-cap: \"Air Quality\"\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + \n        geom_point() + \n        geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE)\n```\nQuarto uses this approach to both better accommodate longer options like fig-cap, fig-subcap, and fig-alt as well as to make it straightforward to edit chunk options within more structured editors that don’t have an easy way to edit chunk metadata (e.g. most traditional notebook UIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that if you prefer it is still possible to include chunk options on the first line (e.g. ```{r, echo = FALSE}). That said, we recommend using the comment-based syntax to make documents more portable and consistent across execution engines.\n\n\nChunk options included this way use YAML syntax rather than R syntax for consistency with options provided in YAML front matter. You can still however use R code for option values by prefacing them with !expr. For example:\n#| fig-cap: !expr paste(\"Air\", \"Quality\")"

Using freeze ensures that you can always reproducibly render your site.\nThe computational results of documents executed with freeze are stored in the _freeze directory, and re-used when needed to fulfill document renders. You should check the contents of _freeze into version control so that others rendering the project don’t need to reproduce your computational environment to render it in their environment.\n\n\nVirtual Environments\nYou can also combine freeze with the use of virtual environments to divide your project into sub-directories that each have their own set of dependencies. This allows multiple collaborators to use a set of localized dependencies for the documents they are responsible for, but at the same time still be able to render the entire project without requiring all of it’s dependencies.\nTo learn how to create and use a virtual environment, see the full documentation on Virtual Environments\nHere’s an example workflow of using virtual environments with freeze:\n\nInclude freeze: true in the project execution options:\nexecute:\n  freeze: true\nCreate a sub-directory of documents (e.g. research), and initialize and use a virtual environment within it:\nresearch/\n  document1.qmd\n  document2.qmd\n  env/\n  requirements.txt\nWhen working wihtin this sub-directory, activate the virtual environment before rendering it’s documents. For example:\ncd research\nsource venv/bin/activate\nquarto render               # render all files in subdir\nquarto render document.qmd  # render a single-file\n\nThis sub-directory render won’t use the cached freeze results but instead will re-run all of the computations using the directory-specific virtual environment. You can of course also include sub-directories within this directory and their documents will also be rendered using the parent virtual environment."

    "section": "Book Structure",
    "text": "The structure of a Quarto book can be as simple as a list of chapters, or can alternatively incorporate multiple parts and/or appendices. Quarto book chapters and sections are automatically numbered (for cross-referencing), however you can also specify that some parts of the book should remain unnumbered.\nThe simple book configuration generated by quarto create-project illustrates the basics:\nbook:\n  title: \"mybook\"\n  author: \"Jane Doe\"\n  date: \"5/9/2021\"\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd\n    - intro.qmd\n    - summary.qmd\n    - references.qmd\n\nThe index file is required and includes preface, acknowledgements, etc. Content in the index file is unnumbered.\nThe remainder of chapters includes one or more book chapters.\nThe references.md file will include the generated bibliography (see References below for details).\n\n\nFormat Options\nIf you want to specify rendering options (including format-specific options), you do it within the _quarto.yml project file rather than within the individual markdown documents. For example:\nhighlight-style: pygments\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: citestyle.csl\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    code-copy: true\nThis is because when rendering a book all of the chapters are combined together into a single document (with a single set of format options).\n\n\nChapter Titles\nSince rendering options are provided in _quarto.yml, you’ll typically see a simple level-one header at the top of chapters. For example:\n# Introduction\nAs compared to typical Quarto documents where you’d see something like this:\n---\ntitle: \"Introduction\"\n---\n\n\nChapter Numbers\nAll chapters are numbered by default. If you want a chapter to be unnumbered simply add the .unnumbered class to it’s main header. For example:\n# Resources {.unnumbered}\nYou can mix together numbered and unnumbered chapters. Note however that while you can link to unnumbered chapters, you can’t cross reference figures, tables, etc. within them. Unnumbered chapters are therefore mostly useful for prefatory content or references at the end of your book.\n\n\nSection Numbers\nYou can set the numbering depth via the number-depth option. For example, to only number sections immediately below the chapter level, use this:\nnumber-depth: 1\nNote that toc-depth is independent of number-depth (i.e. you can have unnumbered entries in the TOC if they are masked out from numbering by number-depth).\n\n\nCover Images\nYou can provide a cover image for EPUB and/or HTML formats using the cover-image option. For example:\nbook:\n  cover-image: cover.png\nYou can also do this on a per-format basis (if for example you want to provide a higher resolution image for EPUB and a lower resolution image for HTML to reduce download time). For example:\nformat:\n   html: \n     cover-image: cover.png\n   epub:\n     cover-image: cover-highres.png\n\n\nReferences\nYou should include a div with the id #refs at the location in your book where you’d like the bibliography to be generated. For example the references.md file generated by quarto create-project includes this:\n# References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\nNote that you can change the chapter title to whatever your like, remove .unnumbered to have it be numbered like other chapters, and add other content before or after the bibliography as necessary.\n\n\nParts & Appendices\nYou can divide your book into parts using part within the book chapters. For example:\nchapters:\n  - index.qmd\n  - preface.qmd\n  - part: dice.qmd\n    chapters: \n      - basics.qmd\n      - packages.qmd\n  - part: cards.qmd\n    chapters:\n      - objects.qmd\n      - notation.qmd\n      - modifying.qmd\n      - environments.qmd\nNote that the markdown files dice.md and cards.md contain the part title (as a level one header) as well as some introductory content for the part. If you just need a part title then you can alternatively use this syntax:\n- part: \"Dice\"\n  chapters: \n    - basics.qmd\n    - packages.qmd\nYou can include appendices by adding an appendices key to your book config. For example:\nbook:\n  title: \"mybook\"\n  author: \"Jane Doe\"\n  date: \"5/9/2021\"\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd\n    - intro.qmd\n    - summary.qmd\n    - references.qmd\n  appendices:\n    - tools.qmd\n    - resources.qmd\n  \nParts and appendices show up like this in HTML output:\n\nIn LaTeX output, the \\part command is used for parts. In EPUB and MS Word output parts are ignored entirely.\nAppendices are numbering using uppercase alpha, and have a prefix inserted into their title to indicate they are an appendix (e.g. “Appendix A — Additional Resources”). You can customize the prefix and delimiter using the following options:\ncrossref:\n  appendix-title: \"App.\"\n  appendix-delim: \":\"\nWhich would result in the above example being out out as: “App. A: Additional Resources”."

Books also may or may not be read digitally (which means that internal hyperlinks may or may not be available).\nTo create books that are consumable in all of these mediums, special care should be taken when creating links to other chapters or sections within chapters (note though that if your book targets only HTML output you can feel free to use conventional hyperlinks).\nNote that if you aren’t already familiar with Quarto Cross References you may want to do so before reading on.\n\nChapters and Sections\nTo make a chapter or section reference-able, you should add a #sec id to it’s main heading. For example:\n# Introduction {#sec:introduction}\nYou can then refer to the chapter or section in one of two ways. To create a normal hyperlink, just use the #sec id:\nSee the [Introduction](#sec:introduction)\nHowever, if you expect that your book will be read in print, just providing the chapter name isn’t all that helpful. Here you’ll want to make a numeric reference (e.g. “see Chapter 4” or “see sec. 4.3”). To refer to a section, just include a cross-reference to it:\nSee @sec:geospatial-analysis for additional discussion.\nTo refer to a chapter or appendix you should spell out “Chapter” or “Appendix” and use the number-only form of cross reference:\nSee [Chapter -@sec:visualization] for more details on visualizing model diagnostics.\nNote that normal Pandoc “heading links” (where no ID is specified, e.g. [Introduction]) will not work within books, you need to add an explicit ID to your sections to link to them.\n\n\nChapter Numbering\nIn books, figures, tables and other cross-reference targets automatically include a chapter number. For example, the following markdown located in Chapter 3 of your book:\nAs illustrated in @fig:geo-comparison, the western states have a much higher incidence of forest fires.\nMight be rendered as:\n\nAs illustrated in fig. 3.2, the western states have a much higher incidence of forest fires.\n\nNote that while books do support unnumbered chapters, you naturally cannot create cross-references to content in chapters without numbers.\n\n\nSection Numbers\nBy default, all headings in your document create a numbered section. You customize numbering depth using the number-depth option. For example, to only number sections immediately below the chapter level, use this:\nnumber-depth: 1\nNote that toc-depth is independent of number-depth (i.e. you can have unnumbered entries in the TOC if they are masked out from numbering by number-depth)."

    "text": "There are a number of ways to control the default width and height of figures generated from code. First, it’s important to know that Quarto sets a default width and height for figures appropriate to the target output format. Here are the defaults (expressed in inches):\n\n\n\nFormat\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nDefault\n7 x 5\n\n\nHTML Slides\n9.5 x 6.5\n\n\nHTML Slides (reveal.js)\n9 x 5\n\n\nPDF\n6.5 x 4.5\n\n\nPDF Slides (Beamer)\n10 x 7\n\n\nPowerPoint\n7.5 x 5.5\n\n\nMS Word, ODT, RTF\n5 x 4\n\n\nEPUB\n5 x 4\n\n\nHugo\n8 x 5\n\n\n\nThese defaults were chosen to provide attractive well proportioned figures, but feel free to experiment to see whether you prefer another default size. You can change the default sizes using the fig-width and fig-height options. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    fig-width: 8\n    fig-height: 6\n  pdf:\n    fig-width: 7\n    fig-height: 5\n---\nHow do these sizes make their way into the engine-level defaults for generating figures? This differs by engine:\n\nFor the Knitr engine, these values become the default values for the fig.width and fig.height chunk options. You can override these default values via chunk level options.\nFor the Jupyter engine, these values are used to set the Matplotlib figure.figsize rcParam (you can of course manually override these defaults for any given plot).\nIf you are using another graphics library with Jupyter and want to utilize these values, you can read them from QUARTO_FIG_WIDTH and QUARTO_FIG_HEIGHT environment variables.\n\n\nCaption and Alt Text\nYou can specify the caption and alt text for figures generated from code using the fig-cap and fig-alt options. For example, here we add these options to a Python code cell that creates a plot:\n```{python}\n#| fig-cap: \"Polar axis plot\"\n#| fig-alt: \"A line plot on a polar axis\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```"

    "text": "Caching\nQuarto integrates with the Jupyter Cache and Knitr Cache to to cache time consuming code chunks. Note that to use Jupyter Cache you’ll want to install the jupyter-cache package:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nWindows\npy -m pip install jupyter-cache\n\n\nMac/Linux\npython3 -m pip install jupyter-cache\n\n\n\nTo enable caching for a document just add the cache option:\nexecute: \n  cache: true\nYou can also use `quarto` command line options to control caching behavior without changing the document’s code. Use options to force the use of caching on all chunks, disable the use of caching on all chunks (even if it’s specified in options), or to force a refresh of the cache even if it has not been invalidated:\nquarto render example.qmd --cache \nquarto render example.qmd --no-cache \nquarto render example.qmd --cache-refresh \nNote that for Jupyter, the cache for a document is invalidated if any of the code blocks change. For Knitr, invalidation occurs on a per-cell basis.\n\n\nDisabling Execution\nIn some cases, you may want to prevent execution entirely. This is especially useful if you author using a standard notebook editor (e.g. JupyterLab) and plan on executing chunks only within the notebook UI. Specify execute: false to skip execution when rendering (you’ll naturally still get the output that was generated within the notebook editor):\nexecute: false\nIf you are temporarily disabling execution and don’t want to overwrite other execute options, you can alternatively just add enabled: false to the execute options:\nexecute:\n  enabled: false\n  echo: true\n  warning: false\nYou might want to have different execution policies for Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) and text-based computational markdown (.qmd). You can do this using the ipynb option:\nexecute:\n  ipynb: false\nYou might use this option if you are implementing of policy of having all notebook execution occur within Jupyter / JupyterLab, while having Quarto still handle converting the notebook to HTML, PDF, etc.\n\n\nJupyter Kernel\nThe Jupyter kernel is determined using the jupyter metdata option. For example, to use the Xeus Python kernel, do this:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\njupyter: xpython\n---\nNote that you can also provide a full kerenlspec, for example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\njupyter: \n  kernelspec:\n    name: \"xpython\"\n    language: \"python\"\n    display_name: \"Python 3.7 (XPython)\"\n---\nIf no Jupyter kernel is specified, then the kernel is determined by finding an available kernel that supports the language of the first executable code block found within the file (e.g. ```{python}).\n\n\nJupyter Daemon\nTo mitigate the ~ 2 second start-up time for the Jupyter Python kernel (and potentially much longer start-up times for other kernels), Quarto keeps a daemon with a running Jupyter kernel alive for each document. This enables subsequent renders to proceed immediately without having to wait for kernel start-up.\nThe purpose of the daemon is to make render more responsive during interactive sessions. Accordingly, no daemon is created when documents are rendered without an active tty or when they are part of a batch rendering (e.g. in a Quarto Project).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that Quarto does not use a daemon by default on Windows (as some Windows systems will not allow the socket connection required by the daemon).\n\n\nYou can customize this behavior using the daemon execution option. Set it to false to prevent the use of a daemon, or set it to a value (in seconds) to determine the period after which the daemon will timeout (the default is 300 seconds). For example:\nexecute:\n  daemon: false\nexecute:\n  daemon: 60\nNote that if you want to use a daemon on Windows you need to enable it explicitly:\nexecute:\n  daemon: true\n\nCommand Line\nYou can also control use of the Jupyter daemon using the following command line options:\n# use a daemon w/ default timeout (300 sec)\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon\n\n# use a daemon w/ an explicit timeout\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon 60\n\n# prevent use of a daemon\nquarto render document.qmd --no-execute-daemon\nYou can also force an existing daemon to restart using the --execute-daemon-restart command line flag:\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon-restart \nThis might be useful if you suspect that the re-use of notebook sessions is causing an error.\nFinally, you can print extended debugging information about daemon usage (startup, shutdown, connections, etc.) using the --execute-debug flag:\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-debug"

    "text": "Quarto will use Pandoc to automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a number of styles. To use this capability, you will need:\n\nA quarto document formatted with citations (see Citation Markdown).\nA bibliographic data source, for example a BibTeX (.bib) file.\nOptionally, a CSL file which specifies the formatting to use when generating the citations and bibliography.\n\n\nBibliography Files\nQuarto supports bibliography files in a wide variety of formats including BibTeX and CSL. Add a bibliography to your document using the bibliography YAML metadata field. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can provide more than one bibliography file if you would like by setting the bibliography field’s value to a YAML array.\n\n\nSee the Pandoc Citations documentation for additional information on bibliography formats.\n\n\nCitation Syntax\nQuarto uses the standard Pandoc markdown representation for citations (e.g. [@citation]) — citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed of ‘@’ + the citation identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a locator, and a suffix. The citation key must begin with a letter, digit, or _, and may contain alphanumerics, _, and internal punctuation characters (:.#$%&-+?<>~/). Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Format\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nBlah Blah [see @knuth1984, pp. 33-35;\nalso @wickham2015, chap. 1]\nBlah Blah [see Knuth (1984), pp. 33-35; also Wickham (2015), chap. 1]\n\n\nBlah Blah [@knuth1984, pp. 33-35,\n38-39 and passim]\nBlah Blah [Knuth (1984), pp. 33-35, 38-39 and passim]\n\n\nBlah Blah [@wickham2015; @knuth1984].\nBlah Blah (Wickham 2015; Knuth 1984).\n\n\nWickham says blah [-@wickham2015]\nWickham says blah (2015)\n\n\n\nYou can also write in-text citations, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Format\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n@knuth1984 says blah.\nKnuth (1984) says blah.\n\n\n@knuth1984 [p. 33] says blah.\nKnuth (1984, 33) says blah.\n\n\n\nSee the Pandoc Citations documentation for additional information on citation syntax.\n\n\nCitation Style\nQuarto uses Pandoc to format citations and bibliographies. By default, Pandoc will use the Chicago Manual of Style author-date format, but you can specify a custom formatting using CSL (Citation Style Language). To provide a custom citation stylesheet, provide a path to a CSL file using the csl metadata field in your document, for example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: nature.csl\n---\nYou can find CSL files or learn more about using styles at the CSL Project. You can browse the list of more than 8,500 Creative Commons CSL definitions in the CSL Project’s central repository or Zotero’s style repository.\n\n\nBibliography Generation\nPandoc will automatically generate a list of works cited and place it in the document if the style calls for it. It will be placed in a div with the id refs if one exists:\n### References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\nIf no such div is found, the works cited list will be placed at the end of the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can suppress generation of a bibliography by including suppress-bibliography: true option in your document metadata\n\n\nHere’s an example of a generated bibliography:\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” The Computer Journal 27 (2): 97–111.\n\n\nWickham, Hadley. 2015. R Packages. 1st ed. O’Reilly Media, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nIncluding Uncited Items\nIf you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can define a dummy nocite metadata field and put the citations there:\n---\nnocite: |\n  @item1, @item2\n---\n\n@item3\nIn this example, the document will contain a citation for item3 only, but the bibliography will contain entries for item1, item2, and item3.\nIt is possible to create a bibliography with all the citations, whether or not they appear in the document, by using a wildcard:\n---\nnocite: |\n  @*\n---"

Additional shortcodes (e.g. for inserting videos, tweets, gists, etc.) will be developed soon.\n\nmeta\nThe meta shortcode allows you to insert content from Pandoc metadata (e.g. YAML at the top of the document and/or in _quarto.yml).\nFor example, the following shortcode inserts the value of the title field from YAML metadata:\n{{< meta title >}}\nYou can dereference sub-keys using the dot (.) delimiter. For example:\n{{< meta author.affiliation >}}\n\n\nvar\nThe var shortcode enables you to insert content from a project-level _variables.yml file. Create this file alongside your _quarto.yml project file, and then include references to those variables within any document in your project.\nVariables can be either simple values or can include arbitrary markdown content. To define variables, create a _variables.yml file in the root directory of your project. For example:\nversion: 1.2\n\nemail:\n  info: info@example.com\n  support: support@example.com\n\nengine:\n  jupyter: \"[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)\"\n  knitr: \"[Knitr](<https://yihui.name/knitr>)\"\nNote that the engine variable values include markdown for hyperlinks.\nTo include the value of a variable, use the {{< var >}} shortcode, for example:\nVersion {{< var version >}} is a minor upgrade.\n\nPlease contact us at {{< var email.info >}}.\n\nQuarto includes {{< var engine.jupyter >}} and \n{{< var engine.knitr >}} computation engines.\n\n\nEscaping\nIf you are writing documentation about using shortcodes (for example, this article!) you might need to prevent them from being processed. You can do this in two ways:\n\nEscape the shortcode reference like this:\n{{</* var version */>}}\nAdd a shortcodes=false attribute to any code block you want to prevent processing of shortcodes within:\n```{shortcodes=false}\n{{< var version >}}\n```"

    "text": "If the base features of Pandoc and Quarto don’t do exactly what you need, you can very likely create a Pandoc Filter that bridges the gap.\nPandoc consists of a set of readers and writers. When converting a document from one format to another, text is parsed by a reader into pandoc’s intermediate representation of the document—an “abstract syntax tree” or AST—which is then converted by the writer into the target format. The pandoc AST format is defined in the module Text.Pandoc.Definition in the pandoc-types package.\nA “filter” is a program that modifies the AST, between the reader and the writer.\nINPUT --reader--> AST --filter--> AST --writer--> OUTPUT\nPandoc’s built-in citation processing is implemented as a filter, as are many of Quarto’s extensions (e.g. cross-references, figure layout, etc.). Some other examples include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ninclude-files\nFilter to include other files in the document.\n\n\ninclude-code-files\nFilter to include code from source files.\n\n\npagebreak\nConverts paragraps containing only the LaTeX \\newpage or \\pagebreak command into appropriate pagebreak markup for other formats.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Filters\nAdd one or more filters to document rendering using the filters option. For example:\nfilters:\n   - include-files.lua\n   - pagebreak.lua\nBy default, user filters are run before Quarto’s built-in filters. If you prefer to control the order of filters visa-vi Quarto just include quarto explicitly as a filter. For example, to run include-files.lua before Quarto filters and pagebreak.lua after, use this:\nfilters:\n  - include-files.lua\n  - quarto\n  - pagebreak.lua\n\n\nWriting Filters\nYou can write Pandoc filters using Lua (via Pandoc’s built-in Lua interpreter) or using any other language using a JSON representation of the Pandoc AST piped to/from an external process.\nWe strongly recommend using Lua Filters, which have the following advantages:\n\nNo external dependencies\nHigh performance (no serialization or process execution overhead)\nAccess to Pandoc’s library of Lua helper functions.\n\nSee the documentation on Writing Lua Filters for additional details.\nIf you want to write a JSON filter, see the documentation on Writing JSON filters."

For example:\n[![Elephant](elephant.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)\n\n\nFigure Alignment\nFigures and their captions are center aligned by default. Add the fig-align attribute to the image to use a different alignment. For example:\n![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n\nAlt Text\nYou can add alternative text to a figure by adding the fig-alt attribute to the image. For example, the following Markdown…\n![](elephant.png){fig-alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\"}\n… will create the following HTML with the corresponding alt tag:\n<img src=\"elephant.png\" alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\">\nNote that the figure caption, title, and alt text can all be different. For example, the following code…\n![Elephant](elephant.png \"Title: An elephant\"){fig-alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\"}\n…produces this HTML:\n<img src=\"elephant.png\" title=\"Title: An elephant\" alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\">\n\n\nLaTeX Environments\nThere are a number of LaTeX packages that provide custom figure environments. For example, the mdframed package includes an mdframed environment used to enclose figures in a special border style. By default, Quarto uses the standard figure environment, but you can use the fig-env attribute to specify a custom one. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"Sidenotes\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    header-includes: |\n      \\usepackage{sidenotes}\n---\n\n![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-env=\"marginfigure\"}"

A simple example:\n::: {layout=\"[25,-2,10]\" layout-valign=\"bottom\"}\n![Surus](surus.png)\n\n![Lin Wang](lin-wang.png)\n:::\n\nNote that vertical alignment isn’t limited to images, you can also vertically align any other elements that are included in a panel."

Here are examples for both Jupyter and Knitr:\nJupyterKnitr\n\n\n```{python} \n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1,23,2,4])\nplt.show()\n\nplt.plot([8,65,23,90])\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n\n```{r}\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\nplot(cars)\nplot(pressure)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nTables\nYou can also use layout attributes for tables produced by Knitr or Jupyter. For example, this Rmd code chunk creates side-by-side tables:\n```{r}\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\nlibrary(knitr)\nkable(head(cars), caption = \"Cars\")\nkable(head(pressure), caption = \"Pressure\")\n```\n\n\n\nCustom Layout\nThe layout works the same way for figures or tables produced by knitr or Jupyter. For example, here’s an Rmd code chunk that produces 3 plots and defines a custom layout for them:\n```{r}\n#| layout: [[45,-10, 45], [100]]\n\nplot(cars)\nplot(pressure)\nplot(mtcars)\n```"

    "section": "CSS Styles",
    "text": "One of the benefits of authoring with markdown is that your content can be easily published to a wide variety of formats. This is possible in significant measure because of the limitations that markdown imposes: you author in terms of the structure and semantics of your content, rather than worrying about specifically how things will appear.\nSometimes however you know that you’ll be publishing to HTML, and you want to exert more control over how things look. In this case, you can use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) along with markdown to do custom formatting. This section covers how to:\n\nDefine CSS styles for your document; and\nApply those styles to entities within your document.\n\nIf you are new to CSS, you may want to brush up on the basics before proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS styles apply only to HTML output, and will not have any impact on the formatting of other output types like PDF or MS Word.\n\n\n\n\nDefining Styles\nThe best way to include CSS styles is to create an external stylesheet (e.g. styles.css), then include it within the output options of your document. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"CSS Demo\"\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    css: styles.css\n---\nThe styles.css file might look something like this:\n.important {\n  color: maroon;\n}\n\n.illustration {\n  border: 1px solid rgb(230, 230, 230); \n}\nNote that it’s also possible to define styles inline with a CSS code chunk, but we recommend using an external file for easier manageability.\nWithin a markdown document you can apply one or more CSS classes to various document entities including headings, images, divs, and spans. CSS classes are applied using pandoc attributes. Once you’ve applied a class to an entity, it will derive its formatting from the CSS properties of the specified class.\n\n\nHeadings\nTo add a CSS class to a heading, use the edit button at the top right of the heading that appears when your cursor is within it (or use the F4 keyboard shortcut):\n\nNote the presence of the .important class within the Edit Attributes dialog.\nCSS classes applied to headings affect all content beneath the heading (an HTML <section> tag is wrapped around the content by Pandoc), so heading classes are a great way to provide custom styles for entire sections of your document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the visual editor doesn’t currently render content using styles applied through CSS classes so you won’t see the custom formatting while editing. You will however see it when rendering and previewing the HTML version of the document.\n\n\n\n\n\nImages\nYou can apply CSS classes to images (for example, to give them a special border) using the standard Image dialog. To do this, double-click the image (or use the F4 shortcut with the image selected) and apply the desired classes:\n\nNote again that the visual editor won’t display your image with the applied CSS classes while editing, however when actually rendering the document to HTML you’ll see the styles reflected.\n\n\nDivs\nDivs are special entities that allow you to apply identifiers and/or styles to a region of a document. Divs are block elements (like paragraphs).\nYou can create divs using the Insert -> Div command, and you can apply attributes (including CSS classes) to divs the same way as you apply attributes to headings (clicking the edit button or using the F4 keyboard shortcut when you are within a div):\n\nNote the presence of the .important class within the Div Attributes dialog.\n\n\nSpans\nSpan are special entities that allow you to apply identifiers and/or styles to a region of text. Spans are inline formatting marks (like bold or italic).\nSpans can be created by selecting text and using the Format -> Span command:\n\nHere we’ve applied a span to the text “customize PDF reports” and we’ve used the span to apply the .important CSS class. Note that as with headings and images the formatting is not displayed in the visual editor, but will be visible when the document is rendered."

    "text": "The Quarto visual editor generates markdown using Pandoc. This means that in some cases your markdown will be rewritten to conform to standard Pandoc idioms. For example, Pandoc inserts 3 spaces after list bullets and automatically escapes characters that might be used for markdown syntax.\nHere is a list of conventions for Pandoc generated markdown that might differ from your own markdown writing style:\n\n*text* is used in preference to _text_\nBacktick code blocks are written as ``` {.md} rather than ```md\nBacktick code blocks with no attributes are rendered as 4-space indented code blocks\nHorizontal rules are written as dashes spanning the full width of the document\nPlain links are written as <https://yihui.org> rather than https://yihui.org\nBullet and numbered lists use additional leading spaces before list item content\nThe blockquote character (>) is included on each new line of a blockquote\nTable captions are written below rather than above tables\nMultiline HTML and TeX blocks use the explicit raw attribute (e.g. ```{=tex})\nInline footnotes are replaced with footnotes immediately below the paragraph\nNested divs use ::: at all levels so long as their attributes are distinct\nUnnumbered sections are designated with {.unnumbered} rather than {-}\nCharacters used for markdown syntax (e.g. *, _, or #) are always escaped\n\nWhile some of this behavior might be bothersome at first, if you decide that visual editing mode is useful for your workflow it’s probably best to just adapt to writing your own markdown the same way that Pandoc does. Note that you can also configure source mode to write markdown using these conventions, ensuring that the same markdown is written no matter which mode edits originate from."

    "title": "Markdown Output",
    "section": "Writer Options",
    "text": "Some aspects of markdown output can be customized via global, project, or file-level options, including:\n\nHow to wrap / break lines (fixed column, sentence-per-line, etc.).\nWhere to write footnotes (below the current paragraph or section, or at the end of the document).\nWhether to use the visual mode markdown writer when saving markdown from source mode (to ensure consistency between documents saved from either mode).\n\nYou can set these options within the R Markdown Global Options or Project Options, or can alternatively set them on a per-file basis using YAML (as described below).\n\nLine Wrapping\nBy default, the visual editor writes Markdown with no line wrapping (paragraphs all occupy a single line). This matches the behavior of markdown source editing mode within RStudio.\nHowever, if you prefer to insert line breaks at a particular column (e.g. 72 or 80), or to insert a line break after each sentence, you can set a global or per-project editor option to this effect.\nYou can also set this behavior on a per-document basis via the wrap option. For example, to wrap lines after 72 characters you would use this:\n---\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: 72\n---\nTo insert a line break after each sentence, use wrap: sentence. For example:\n---\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: sentence\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithm used for sentence wrapping will handle English and Japanese text well, but may not detect the end of sentences accurately for other languages.\n\n\n\nIf you have enabled a global line wrapping option and want to turn off wrapping for a given document, use wrap: none.\n\n\nReferences\nBy default, references are written at the end of the block where their corresponding footnote appears. You can override this behavior using the references option.\nFor example, to write references at the end of sections rather than blocks you would use:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    references: \n      location: block\n---\nValid values for the references option are block, section, and document.\nNote that you can also set a global or per-project editor option to control reference writing behavior.\nIf you are aggregating a set of markdown documents into a larger work, you may want to make sure that reference identifiers are unique across all of your documents (e.g. you don’t want to have [^1] appear multiple times). You can ensure uniqueness via the prefix option. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    references: \n      location: block\n      prefix: \"mydoc\"\n---\nThis will result in footnotes in this document using the specified prefix (e.g. [^mydoc-1]), ensuring they are globally unique across the manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you are within a Quarto book project then a references prefix is applied automatically so no changes to editor_options are required.\n\n\n\n\n\nCanonical Mode\nIf you have a workflow that involves editing in both visual and source mode, you may want to ensure that the same markdown is written no matter which mode edits originate from. You can accomplish this using the canonical option. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor_options:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: 72\n    references: \n      location: block\n    canonical: true\n---\nWith canonical: true, edits in visual mode and source mode will result in identical markdown output. This is especially useful if you have multiple authors collaborating using version control, with a mixture of source and visual mode editing among the authors."

Citations can be inserted from a variety of sources:\n\nYour document bibliography.\nZotero personal or group libraries.\nDOI (Document Object Identifier) references.\nSearches of Crossref, DataCite, or PubMed.\n\nIf you insert citations from Zotero, DOI look-up, or a search then they are automatically added to your document bibliography.\n\nBibliographies\nPandoc supports bibliographies in a wide variety of formats including BibTeX and CSL. Add a bibliography to your document using the bibliography YAML metadata field. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\nlink-citations: true\n---\nNote that we’ve also specified the link-citations option, which will make your citations hyperlinks to the corresponding bibliography entries.\nSee the Pandoc Citations documentation for additional information on bibliography formats.\n\n\nInserting Citations\nYou insert citations by either using the Insert -> Citation command or by using markdown syntax directly (e.g. [@cite] or @cite) .\nCitations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed of ‘@’ + the citation identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a locator, and a suffix. The citation key must begin with a letter, digit, or _, and may contain alphanumerics, _, and internal punctuation characters (:.#$%&-+?<>~/). Here are some examples:\n\n  \n    Blah Blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, chap. 1].\n  \n\n\n  Blah Blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and passim].\n  \n\n\n  Blah Blah [@smith04;\n  @doe99].\n\n  Smith says blah [-@smith04].\n  \n\nYou can also write in-text citations, as follows:\n\n  \n    @smith04 says blah.\n  \n  \n    @smith04 [p. 33] says blah.\n  \n\nSee the Pandoc Citations documentation for additional information on citation syntax.\nUse the  toolbar button or the ⇧⌘ F8 keyboard shortcut to show the Insert Citation dialog:\n\nNote that you can insert multiple citations by using the add button on the right side of the item display.\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nYou can also insert citations directly using markdown syntax (e.g. [@cite]). When you do this a completion interface is provided for searching available citations:\n\n\n\nCitation IDs\nBefore inserting a citation from an external source you will may wish to customize it’s ID. Within the Insert Citation dialog, click the edit button on the right side of citations to change their ID:\n\nIf you insert a new citation via code completion, you will also be provided with the opportunity to change its default citation ID.\nFor citations inserted from Zotero, you can also use the Better BibTeX plugin to generate citation IDs (this can be enabled via Citation Options if you have Better BibTeX installed).\n\n\nCitation Preview\nOnce you’ve inserted a citation, place the cursor over it to see a preview of it along with a link to the source if one is available:\n\n\n\n\nCitations from DOIs\nUse the From DOI pane of the Insert Citation dialog to insert a citation based on a DOI (e.g that you have retrieved from a PubMed or other search):\n\nIf you are using markdown syntax, you can also paste a DOI after the [@ and it will be looked up:\n\nOnce you’ve confirmed that it’s the correct work (and possibly modified the suggested ID), the citation will be inserted into the document and an entry for the work added to your bibliography.\n\n\nCitations from Search\nUse the Crossref, DataCite, and PubMed panes of the Insert Citation dialog to search one of those services for a citation:\n\nItems inserted from a search will automatically be added to your bibliography.\nNote that for PubMed queries you can use the full supported query syntax. For example, this query searches on the author and title fields: Peterson[Author] AND Embolism[Title]. You can learn more about building PubMed queries here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/advanced/.\n\n\nCitations from Zotero\nZotero is a popular free and open source reference manager. If you use Zotero, you can also insert citations directly from your Zotero libraries. If you have Zotero installed locally it’s location will be detected automatically and citations from your main library (My Library) will be available:\n\nZotero references will also show up automatically in completions:\n\nItems from Zotero will appear alongside items from your bibliography with a small “Z” logo juxtaposed over them. If you insert a citation from Zotero that isn’t already in your bibliography then it will be automatically added to the bibliography.\nIf you are running both RStudio and Zotero on your desktop, then no additional configuration is required for connecting to your Zotero library. If however you using RStudio Server and/or want to access your Zotero library over the web, then a few more steps are required (see the Zotero Web API section for details).\n\nGroup Libraries\nZotero Groups provide a powerful way to share collections with a class or work closely with colleagues on a project. By default, Zotero Group Libraries are not included in the Insert Citation dialog or citation completions. However, there are options available to use group libraries at a global, per-project, or per-document level.\nFor example, here we specify a project-level option to use the Reproducible Research Series (Year 1) group library:\n\nYou can also specify one or more libraries within YAML. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"Reproducible Research\"\nzotero: \"Reproducible Research Series (Year 1)\"\n---\nNote that you can also turn off Zotero entirely for a document using zotero: false:\n---\ntitle: \"Reproducible Research\"\nzotero: false\n---\n\n\nZotero Web API\nIf you are using RStudio Server and/or don’t have Zotero installed locally, you can still access your Zotero library using the Zotero Web API (assuming you have a Zotero web account and have synced your libraries to your account).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are running RStudio Desktop, it’s generally easier to also run Zotero on your desktop and access your library locally. That said, it is possible to access Zotero web libraries from RStudio Desktop if you prefer that configuration.\n\n\n\n\nAPI Access Key\nRStudio accesses Zotero web libraries using the Zotero Web API, so the first step is to create a Zotero account and then configure Zotero to sync it’s data to your account. You can do this using the Sync tab of the Zotero preferences:\n\nOnce you’ve configured your library to sync, you need to create a Zotero API Key to use with RStudio:\n\nFollow the instructions to create a new access key. Note that if you want to use Group Libraries with RStudio that you should change the default to provide read-only access to groups (as illustrated above).\nBe sure to record your key after generating it (i.e. copy it to the clipboard and/or save it somewhere more permanent) as you won’t be able to view it again after you navigate away.\nFinally, go to the R Markdown -> Citations preferences to connect Zotero to RStudio using your key:\n\nSet the Zotero Library option to “Web”, then paste in your Zotero Web API Key. You can use Verify Key… button to confirm that your Zotero API key is working correctly.\nOnce you’ve confirmed your connection you are ready to start inserting citations from Zotero."

To do this add the canonical option.

    "text": "To break this down more clearly, let’s revisit the “Hello, Shiny” document we started with in the introduction to interactive documents:\n---\ntitle: \"Old Faithful\"\nformat: html\nserver: shiny\n---\n\n```{r}\nsliderInput(\"bins\", \"Number of bins:\", \n            min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)\nplotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| context: server\noutput$distPlot <- renderPlot({\n  x <- faithful[, 2]  # Old Faithful Geyser data\n  bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)\n  hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')\n})\n```\nHere is how execution breaks down for this document:\n\nThe first code chunk that contains the calls to sliderInput() and plotOutput() will execute when you render the document (e.g. quarto render old-faithful.qmd).\nThe second code chunk with the context: server option will not execute at render time, but rather will execute only when the document is served.\n\nIt’s critical to understand that the two chunks are run in completely separate R sessions. That means that you cannot access variables created in the first chunk within the second, and vice-versa. The is analogous to the ui.R and server.R scripts that compose most normal Shiny applications.\nOf course, it’s quite useful to be able to re-use code between contexts, and we’ll cover some ways to do this in the Sharing Code section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make the code of interactive documents straightforward to understand and work with, we strongly recommend that your server contexts (there can be more than one) be located at the bottom of the document. This makes the separate execution environments more clear in the flow of the document source code.\n\n\n\n\nserver.R\nThere is one other option if you prefer to have a stronger separation. You can restrict your .qmd file to only code that will execute at render time, and then split out the server code into a separate server.R file.\nRe-writing our example in this fashion would look like this:\n\nold-faithful.qmd\n---\ntitle: \"Old Faithful\"\nformat: html\nserver: shiny\n---\n\n```{r}\nsliderInput(\"bins\", \"Number of bins:\", \n            min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)\nplotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n```\n\n\nserver.R\nfunction(input, output, session) {\n  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({\n    x <- faithful[, 2]  # Old Faithful Geyser data\n    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)\n    hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')\n  })\n}\nThis is perhaps a bit less convenient but does align better with the traditional ui.R / server.R separation that exists in traditional Shiny applications."

    "title": "Execution Contexts",
    "section": "Sharing Code",
    "text": "Sharing code between rendering contexts works a bit differently depending on if your code is in a single .qmd file or if it uses server.R. We’ll cover both scenarios below.\n\nSingle File\n\ncontext: setup\nTo have code execute in both rendering and serving contexts, create a code chunk with context: setup. For example:\n```{r}\n#| context: setup\n#| include: false\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# load data\ndataset <- import_data(\"data.csv\")\ndataset <- sample_n(dataset, 1000)\n```\nThis code will execute at both render time as well as when the server is created for each new user session. Note that we also specify include: false to make sure that code, warnings, and output from the chunk are not included in the rendered document.\n\n\ncontext: data\nThe loading and manipulation of data often dominates the startup time of Shiny applications. Since interactive documents are executed in two phases (the initial render and then the serving of the document to users) we can perform the expensive data manipulations during rendering and then simply load the data when starting up the application.\nYou can define prerendered data by adding the context: data option to an R code chunk. The chunk will be executed during render and any R objects it creates will be saved to an .RData file, which will then be loaded during Shiny server startup. For example, we could take the the setup chunk illustrated above and factor out the data loading into its own chunk:\n```{r}\n#| context: data\n#| include: false\n\ndataset <- import_data(\"data.csv\")\ndataset <- sample_n(dataset, 1000)\n```\nNote that R objects created within a context: data chunk are available to both the UI rendering and server contexts.\n\n\nKnitr cache\nYou can further improve the performance of data rendering by adding the cache: true option to the data chunk. This will cause the code chunk to be re-executed only when required. For example:\n```{r}\n#| context: data\n#| include: false\n#| cache: true\n#| cache.extra: !expr file.info(\"data.csv\")$mtime\n\ndataset <- import_data(\"data.csv\")\ndataset <- sample_n(dataset, 1000)\n```\nIn this example the cache will be invalidated if either the R code in the chunk changes or the modification time of the “data.csv” file changes (this is accomplished using the cache.extra option).\nYou can also invalidate an existing cache by removing the _cache directory alongside with your interactive document.\n\n\ncontext: server-start\nThere is one additional execution context that enables you to share code and data across multiple user sessions. Chunks with context: server-start executee once when the Shiny document is first run and are not re-executed for each new user of the document. Using context: server-start is appropriate for several scenarios including:\n\nEstablishing shared connections to remote servers (e.g. databases, Spark contexts, etc.).\nCreating reactive values intended to be shared across sessions (e.g. with reactivePoll or reactiveFileReader).\n\nFor example:\n```{r}\n#| context: server-start\n\nlibrary(DBI)\ndb <- dbConnect(...)\n```\n\n\n\nMultiple Files\nIf your interactive document uses a .qmd file to define the user-interface and a server.R file for the server, you can put shared code in a file named global.R. Functions and variables defined within global.R will be available both during render as well as during execution of the server.\nIn this scenario your interactive document consists of 3 source files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndoc.qmd\nMarkdown content as well as Shiny inputs and outputs (e.g. sliderInput(), plotOutput(), etc.)\n\n\nserver.R\nMain server function with reactive expressions, assignments to outputs, etc.\n\n\nglobal.R\nCode shared between doc.qmd and server.R."
