If you are working on a file with computations (e.g. an Rmd or Jupyter notebook) then you need to explicitly re-render it to update the preview.\nNote that development server updates do not cause an update to the final book output.

For projects, you typically provide the format configuration in _quarto.yml so may not have a format key in individual documents.\nHowever, since RStudio v1.4 is not aware of Quarto projects, you should add an explicit entry in YAML front-matter to ensure that Quarto (rather than the rmarkdown package) is used for rendering:\n---\ntitle: \"My Page\"\nknit: quarto render\n---\n\n\nPublishing\nWhen you are ready to publish the book, use the render command to render all output formats:\nquarto render --to all\nIf you pass no arguments to quarto render the default format (HTML) will be rendered.

    "title": "Book Authoring",
    "section": "Book Structure",
    "text": "The structure of a Quarto book can be as simple as a list of chapters, or can alternatively incorporate multiple parts and/or appendices. Quarto book chapters and sections are automatically numbered (for cross-referencing), however you can also specify that some parts of the book should remain unnumbered.\nThe simple book configuration generated by quarto create-project illustrates the basics:\nbook:\n  title: \"mybook\"\n  author: \"Jane Doe\"\n  date: \"5/9/2021\"\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd\n    - intro.qmd\n    - summary.qmd\n    - references.qmd\n\nThe index file is required and includes preface, acknowledgements, etc. Content in the index file is unnumbered.\nThe remainder of chapters includes one or more book chapters.\nThe references.md file will include the generated bibliography (see References below for details).\n\n\nFormat Options\nIf you want to specify rendering options (including format-specific options), you do it within the _quarto.yml project file rather than within the individual markdown documents. For example:\nhighlight-style: pygments\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: citestyle.csl\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    code-copy: true\nThis is because when rendering a book all of the chapters are combined together into a single document (with a single set of format options).\n\n\nChapter Titles\nSince rendering options are provided in _quarto.yml, you’ll typically see a simple level-one header at the top of chapters. For example:\n# Introduction\nAs compared to typical Quarto documents where you’d see something like this:\n---\ntitle: \"Introduction\"\n---\n\n\nChapter Numbers\nAll chapters are numbered by default. If you want a chapter to be unnumbered simply add the .unnumbered class to it’s main header. For example:\n# Resources {.unnumbered}\nYou can mix together numbered and unnumbered chapters. Note however that while you can link to unnumbered chapters, you can’t cross reference figures, tables, etc. within them. Unnumbered chapters are therefore mostly useful for prefatory content or references at the end of your book.\n\n\nSection Numbers\nYou can set the numbering depth via the number-depth option. For example, to only number sections immediately below the chapter level, use this:\nnumber-depth: 1\nNote that toc-depth is independent of number-depth (i.e. you can have unnumbered entries in the TOC if they are masked out from numbering by number-depth).\n\n\nCover Images\nYou can provide a cover image for EPUB and/or HTML formats using the cover-image option. For example:\nbook:\n  cover-image: cover.png\nYou can also do this on a per-format basis (if for example you want to provide a higher resolution image for EPUB and a lower resolution image for HTML to reduce download time). For example:\nformat:\n   html: \n     cover-image: cover.png\n   epub:\n     cover-image: cover-highres.png\n\n\nReferences\nYou should include a div with the id #refs at the location in your book where you’d like the bibliography to be generated. For example the references.md file generated by quarto create-project includes this:\n# References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\nNote that you can change the chapter title to whatever your like, remove .unnumbered to have it be numbered like other chapters, and add other content before or after the bibliography as necessary.\n\n\nParts & Appendices\nYou can divide your book into parts using part within the book chapters. For example:\nchapters:\n  - index.qmd\n  - preface.qmd\n  - part: dice.qmd\n    chapters: \n      - basics.qmd\n      - packages.qmd\n  - part: cards.qmd\n    chapters:\n      - objects.qmd\n      - notation.qmd\n      - modifying.qmd\n      - environments.qmd\nNote that the markdown files dice.md and cards.md contain the part title (as a level one header) as well as some introductory content for the part. If you just need a part title then you can alternatively use this syntax:\n- part: \"Dice\"\n  chapters: \n    - basics.qmd\n    - packages.qmd\nYou can include appendices by adding an appendices key to your book config. For example:\nbook:\n  title: \"mybook\"\n  author: \"Jane Doe\"\n  date: \"5/9/2021\"\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd\n    - intro.qmd\n    - summary.qmd\n    - references.qmd\n  appendices:\n    - tools.qmd\n    - resources.qmd\n  \nParts and appendices show up like this in HTML output:\n\nIn LaTeX output, the \\part command is used for parts. In EPUB and MS Word output parts are ignored entirely.\nAppendices are numbering using uppercase alpha, and have a prefix inserted into their title to indicate they are an appendix (e.g. “Appendix A — Additional Resources”). You can customize the prefix and delimiter using the following options:\ncrossref:\n  appendix-title: \"App.\"\n  appendix-delim: \":\"\nWhich would result in the above example being out out as: “App. A: Additional Resources.”"

    "section": "Cross References",
    "text": "One important difference between creating a website and a book is that in addition to their web output, books are also rendered as a single contiguous document (e.g a PDF). Books also may or may not be read digitally (which means that internal hyperlinks may or may not be available).\nTo create books that are consumable in all of these mediums, special care should be taken when creating links to other chapters or sections within chapters (note though that if your book targets only HTML output you can feel free to use conventional hyperlinks).\nNote that if you aren’t already familiar with Quarto Cross References you may want to do so before reading on.\n\nChapters and Sections\nTo make a chapter or section reference-able, you should add a #sec id to it’s main heading. For example:\n# Introduction {#sec:introduction}\nYou can then refer to the chapter or section in one of two ways. To create a normal hyperlink, just use the #sec id:\nSee the [Introduction](#sec:introduction)\nHowever, if you expect that your book will be read in print, just providing the chapter name isn’t all that helpful. Here you’ll want to make a numeric reference (e.g. “see Chapter 4” or “see sec. 4.3”). To refer to a section, just include a cross-reference to it:\nSee @sec:geospatial-analysis for additional discussion.\nTo refer to a chapter or appendix you should spell out “Chapter” or “Appendix” and use the number-only form of cross reference:\nSee [Chapter -@sec:visualization] for more details on visualizing model diagnostics.\nNote that normal Pandoc “heading links” (where no ID is specified, e.g. [Introduction]) will not work within books, you need to add an explicit ID to your sections to link to them.\n\n\nChapter Numbering\nIn books, figures, tables and other cross-reference targets automatically include a chapter number. For example, the following markdown located in Chapter 3 of your book:\nAs illustrated in @fig:geo-comparison, the western states have a much higher incidence of forest fires.\nMight be rendered as:\n\nAs illustrated in fig. 3.2, the western states have a much higher incidence of forest fires.\n\nNote that while books do support unnumbered chapters, you naturally cannot create cross-references to content in chapters without numbers.\n\n\nSection Numbers\nBy default, all headings in your document create a numbered section. You customize numbering depth using the number-depth option. For example, to only number sections immediately below the chapter level, use this:\nnumber-depth: 1\nNote that toc-depth is independent of number-depth (i.e. you can have unnumbered entries in the TOC if they are masked out from numbering by number-depth)."

    "title": "Book Authoring",
    "section": "Code Execution",
    "text": "As with standalone Quarto documents, book chapters can be either plain markdown or use computational markdown (via knitr or Jupyter). However, if you have expensive computations in one or more of your chapters this can make the time required to render the entire book unacceptably long. Quarto has a few different tools you can use to overcome this problem.\n\nIncremental Render\nWhen developing a book you are typically rendering only a single chapter to preview what it will look like. Quarto renders chapters incrementally, so for example if you are working on a PDF book and you render chapter 5, you’ll still get a preview of the entire book but with only the chapter 5 changes (the other chapters automatically use previously rendered versions).\n\n\nFreezing\nYou can use the freeze option to denote that computational documents should never be re-rendered, or alternatively only be re-rendered when their source file changes:\nfreeze: true  # never re-render\nfreeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes\nNote that you’ll still want to take care to fully re-render your book when things outside of source code change (e.g. input data). You can remove previously frozen output by deleting the _freeze folder at the root of your book project.\n\n\nCaching\nYou can use the cache option to cache the results of computations (using the knitr cache for Rmd documents, and Jupyter Cache for .ipynb or Jupyter Markdown documents):\ncache: true\nNote that cache invalidation is triggered by changes in chunk source code (or other cache attributes you’ve defined). You may however need to manually refresh the cache if you know that some other input (or even time) has changed sufficiently to warrant an update. To do this, render either individual files or an entire project using the --cache-refresh option:\nquarto render mydoc.qmd --cache-refresh # single doc\nquarto render --cache-refresh           # entire project\n\n\nNo Execute\nFinally, if you are using Jupyter Notebooks as inputs, you may prefer to execute all code within interactive notebook sessions, and never have Quarto execute the code cells:\nexecute: false\nYou can specify this option either globally or per-notebook."

You can change this via the output-file option:\nbook:\n  title: \"My Book\"\n  output-file: \"my-book\"\nNote that the output-file should not have a file extension (that will be provided automatically as appropriate for each format).\n\n\nLaTeX Output\nIn some cases you’ll want to do customization of the LaTeX output before creating the final printed manuscript (e.g. to affect how text flows between pages or within and around figures). The best way to approach this is to develop your book all the way to completion, then render with the keep-tex option:\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    keep-tex: true\nThe complete LaTeX source code of your book will be output into the main book source directory (e.g. to “my-book.tex”). This LaTeX can be compiled without Quarto, so is suitable for submitting to an external publisher.\nAt this point you should probably make a copy of the book directory to perform your final LaTeX modifications within (since the modifications you make to LaTeX will not be preserved in your markdown source, and will therefore be overwritten the next time you render)."

    "text": "There are a number of ways to control the default width and height of figures generated from code. First, it’s important to know that Quarto sets a default width and height for figures appropriate to the target output format. Here are the defaults (expressed in inches):\n\n\n\nFormat\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nDefault\n7 x 5\n\n\nHTML Slides\n9.5 x 6.5\n\n\nHTML Slides (reveal.js)\n9 x 5\n\n\nPDF\n6.5 x 4.5\n\n\nPDF Slides (Beamer)\n10 x 7\n\n\nPowerPoint\n7.5 x 5.5\n\n\nMS Word, ODT, RTF\n5 x 4\n\n\nEPUB\n5 x 4\n\n\nHugo\n8 x 5\n\n\n\nThese defaults were chosen to provide attractive well proportioned figures, but feel free to experiment to see whether you prefer another default size. You can change the default sizes using the fig-width and fig-height options. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    fig-width: 8\n    fig-height: 6\n  pdf:\n    fig-width: 7\n    fig-height: 5\n---\nHow do these sizes make their way into the engine-level defaults for generating figures? This differs by engine:\n\nFor the Knitr engine, these values become the default values for the fig.width and fig.height chunk options. You can override these default values via chunk level options.\nFor the Jupyter engine, these values are used to set the Matplotlib figure.figsize rcParam (you can of course manually override these defaults for any given plot).\nIf you are using another graphics library with Jupyter and want to utilize these values, you can read them from QUARTO_FIG_WIDTH and QUARTO_FIG_HEIGHT environment variables.\n\n\nCaption and Alt Text\nYou can specify the caption and alt text for figures generated from code using the fig.cap and fig.alt options. For example, here we add these options to a Python code cell that creates a plot:\n```{python}\n#| fig.cap: \"Polar axis plot\"\n#| fig.alt: \"A line plot on a polar axis\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```"

    "text": "Caching\nQuarto integrates with the Jupyter Cache and Knitr Cache to to cache time consuming code chunks. Note that to use Jupyter Cache you’ll want to install the jupyter-cache package:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nWindows\npy -m pip install jupyter-cache\n\n\nMac/Linux\npython3 -m pip install jupyter-cache\n\n\n\nTo enable caching for a document just add the cache option:\nexecute: \n  cache: true\nYou can also use `quarto` command line options to control caching behavior without changing the document’s code. Use options to force the use of caching on all chunks, disable the use of caching on all chunks (even if it’s specified in options), or to force a refresh of the cache even if it has not been invalidated:\nquarto render example.qmd --cache \nquarto render example.qmd --no-cache \nquarto render example.qmd --cache-refresh \nNote that for Jupyter, the cache for a document is invalidated if any of the code blocks change. For Knitr, invalidation occurs on a per-cell basis.\n\n\nDisabling Execution\nIn some cases, you may want to prevent execution entirely. This is especially useful if you author using a standard notebook editor (e.g. JupyterLab) and plan on executing chunks only within the notebook UI. Specify execute: false to skip execution when rendering (you’ll naturally still get the output that was generated within the notebook editor):\nexecute: false\nIf you are temporarily disabling execution and don’t want to overwrite other execute options, you can alternatively just add enabled: false to the execute options:\nexecute:\n  enabled: false\n  echo: true\n  warning: false\nYou might want to have different execution policies for Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) and text-based computational markdown (.qmd). You can do this using the ipynb option:\nexecute:\n  ipynb: false\nYou might use this option if you are implementing of policy of having all notebook execution occur within Jupyter / Jupyter Lab, while having Quarto still handle converting the notebook to HTML, PDF, etc.\n\n\nJupyter Kernel\nThe Jupyter kernel is determined using the jupyter metdata option. For example, to use the Xeus Python kernel, do this:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\njupyter: xpython\n---\nNote that you can also provide a full kerenlspec, for example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\njupyter: \n  kernelspec:\n    name: \"xpython\"\n    language: \"python\"\n    display_name: \"Python 3.7 (XPython)\"\n---\nIf no Jupyter kernel is specified, then the kernel is determined by finding an available kernel that supports the language of the first executable code block found within the file (e.g. ```{python}).\n\n\nJupyter Daemon\nTo mitigate the ~ 2 second start-up time for the Jupyter Python kernel (and potentially much longer start-up times for other kernels), Quarto keeps a daemon with a running Jupyter kernel alive for each document. This enables subsequent renders to proceed immediately without having to wait for kernel start-up.\nThe purpose of the daemon is to make render more responsive during interactive sessions. Accordingly, no daemon is created when documents are rendered without an active tty or when they are part of a batch rendering (e.g. in a Quarto Project).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that Quarto does not use a daemon by default on Windows (as some Windows systems will not allow the socket connection required by the daemon).\n\n\nYou can customize this behavior using the daemon execution option. Set it to false to prevent the use of a daemon, or set it to a value (in seconds) to determine the period after which the daemon will timeout (the default is 300 seconds). For example:\nexecute:\n  daemon: false\nexecute:\n  daemon: 60\nNote that if you want to use a daemon on Windows you need to enable it explicitly:\nexecute:\n  daemon: true\n\nCommand Line\nYou can also control use of the Jupyter daemon using the following command line options:\n# use a daemon w/ default timeout (300 sec)\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon\n\n# use a daemon w/ an explicit timeout\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon 60\n\n# prevent use of a daemon\nquarto render document.qmd --no-execute-daemon\nYou can also force an existing daemon to restart using the --execute-daemon-restart command line flag:\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-daemon-restart \nThis might be useful if you suspect that the re-use of notebook sessions is causing an error.\nFinally, you can print extended debugging information about daemon usage (startup, shutdown, connections, etc.) using the --execute-debug flag:\nquarto render document.qmd --execute-debug"

Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Format\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nBlah Blah [see @knuth1984, pp. 33-35;\nalso @wickham2015, chap. 1]\nBlah Blah (see Knuth 1984, 33–35; also Wickham 2015, chap. 1)\n\n\nBlah Blah [@knuth1984, pp. 33-35,\n38-39 and passim]\nBlah Blah (Knuth 1984, 33–35, 38–39 and passim)\n\n\nBlah Blah [@wickham2015; @knuth1984].\nBlah Blah (Wickham 2015; Knuth 1984).\n\n\nWickham says blah [-@wickham2015]\nWickham says blah (2015)\n\n\n\nYou can also write in-text citations, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Format\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n@knuth1984 says blah.\nKnuth (1984) says blah.\n\n\n@knuth1984 [p. 33] says blah.\nKnuth (1984, 33) says blah.\n\n\n\nSee the Pandoc Citations documentation for additional information on citation syntax.\n\n\nCitation Style\nQuarto uses Pandoc to format citations and bibliographies. By default, Pandoc will use the Chicago Manual of Style author-date format, but you can specify a custom formatting using CSL (Citation Style Language). To provide a custom citation stylesheet, provide a path to a CSL file using the csl metadata field in your document, for example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: nature.csl\n---\nYou can find CSL files or learn more about using styles at the CSL Project. You can browse the list of more than 8,500 Creative Commons CSL definitions in the CSL Project’s central repository or Zotero’s style repository.\n\n\nBibliography Generation\nPandoc will automatically generate a list of works cited and place it in the document if the style calls for it. It will be placed in a div with the id refs if one exists:\n### References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\nIf no such div is found, the works cited list will be placed at the end of the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can suppress generation of a bibliography by including suppress-bibliography: true option in your document metadata\n\n\nHere’s an example of a generated bibliography:\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” The Computer Journal 27 (2): 97–111.\n\n\nWickham, Hadley. 2015. R Packages. 1st ed. O’Reilly Media, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nIncluding Uncited Items\nIf you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can define a dummy nocite metadata field and put the citations there:\n---\nnocite: |\n  @item1, @item2\n---\n\n@item3\nIn this example, the document will contain a citation for item3 only, but the bibliography will contain entries for item1, item2, and item3.\nIt is possible to create a bibliography with all the citations, whether or not they appear in the document, by using a wildcard:\n---\nnocite: |\n  @*\n---"

    "text": "Shortcodes are special markdown directives that generate various types of content. Quarto shortcodes are similar in form and function to Hugo shortcodes and WordPress shortcodes.\nQuarto currently supports just two shortcodes: meta and var. Additional shortcodes (e.g. for inserting videos, tweets, gists, etc.) will be developed soon.\n\nmeta\nThe meta shortcode allows you to insert content from Pandoc metadata (e.g. YAML at the top of the document and/or in _quarto.yml).\nFor example, the following shortcode inserts the value of the title field from YAML metadata:\n{{< meta title >}}\nYou can dereference sub-keys using the dot (.) delimiter. For example:\n{{< meta author.affiliation >}}\n\n\nvar\nThe var shortcode enables you to insert content from a project-level _variables.yml file. Create this file alongside your _quarto.yml project file, and then include references to those variables within any document in your project.\nVariables can be either simple values or can include arbitrary markdown content. To define variables, create a _variables.yml file in the root directory of your project. For example:\nversion: 1.2\n\nemail:\n  info: info@example.com\n  support: support@example.com\n\nengine:\n  jupyter: \"[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)\"\n  knitr: \"[Knitr](<https://yihui.name/knitr>)\"\nNote that the engine variable values include markdown for hyperlinks.\nTo include the value of a variable, use the {{< var >}} shortcode, for example:\nVersion {{< var version >}} is a minor upgrade.\n\nPlease contact us at {{< var email.info >}}.\n\nQuarto includes {{< var engine.jupyter >}} and \n{{< var engine.knitr >}} computation engines.\n\n\nEscaping\nIf you are writing documentation about using shortcodes (for example, this article!) you might need to prevent them from being processed. You can do this in two ways:\n\nEscape the shortcode reference like this:\n{{</* var version */>}}\nAdd a shortcodes=false attribute to any code block you want to prevent processing of shortcodes within:\n```{shortcodes=false}\n{{< var version >}}\n```"

    "text": "If the base features of Pandoc and Quarto don’t do exactly what you need, you can very likely create a Pandoc Filter that bridges the gap.\nPandoc consists of a set of readers and writers. When converting a document from one format to another, text is parsed by a reader into pandoc’s intermediate representation of the document—an “abstract syntax tree” or AST—which is then converted by the writer into the target format. The pandoc AST format is defined in the module Text.Pandoc.Definition in the pandoc-types package.\nA “filter” is a program that modifies the AST, between the reader and the writer.\nINPUT --reader--> AST --filter--> AST --writer--> OUTPUT\nPandoc’s built-in citation processing is implemented as a filter, as are many of Quarto’s extensions (e.g. cross-references, figure layout, etc.). Some other examples include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ninclude-files\nFilter to include other files in the document.\n\n\ninclude-code-files\nFilter to include code from source files.\n\n\npagebreak\nConverts paragraps containing only the LaTeX \\newpage or \\pagebreak command into appropriate pagebreak markup for other formats.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Filters\nAdd one or more filters to document rendering using the filters option. For example:\nfilters:\n   - include-files.lua\n   - pagebreak.lua\nBy default, user filters are run before Quarto’s built-in filters. If you prefer to control the order of filters visa-vi Quarto just include quarto explicitly as a filter. For example, to run include-files.lua before Quarto filters and pagebreak.lua after, use this:\nfilters:\n  - include-files.lua\n  - quarto\n  - pagebreak.lua\n\n\nWriting Filters\nYou can write Pandoc filters using Lua (via Pandoc’s built-in Lua interpreter) or using any other language using a JSON representation of the Pandoc AST piped to/from an external process.\nWe strongly recommend using Lua Filters, which have the following advantages:\n\nNo external dependencies\nHigh performance (no serialization or process execution overhead)\nAccess to Pandoc’s library of Lua helper functions.\n\nSee the documentation on Writing Lua Filters for additional details.\nIf you want to write a JSON filter, see the documentation on Writing JSON filters."

This enables you to use the following syntax to refer to it elsewhere in the document:\nSee @fig-elephant for an illustration.\nHere is what this would look like rendered to HTML:\n\nQuarto enables you to create cross-references to figures, tables, equations, sections, code listings, theorems, proofs, and more.

There are however several differences (mostly related to handling computational output) to note:\n\nQuarto uses the prefix #fig- rather than #fig: (which is more compatible with Jupyter notebook cell ids).\nQuarto is able to reference raw HTML and LaTeX figures and tables (which are often produced by executable code blocks).\nQuarto has support for referencing theorems and proofs (and related types)."

To do this, enclose the figures in a div (with it’s own label and caption) and give each subfigure it’s own label and caption. You can then refer to either the entire figure in a reference or a single subfigure:\n::: {#fig-elephants layout.ncol=2}\n\n![Surus](surus.png){#fig-surus}\n\n![Hanno](hanno.png){#fig-hanno}\n\nFamous Elephants\n:::\n\nSee @fig-elephants for examples.

See the article on Figures and Layout for more details on laying out panels of figures.\n\n\nComputations\nFigures produced by Jupyter and Knitr can also be cross-referenced. To do this, add a label and fig.cap option at the top of the code block. For example:\nJupyterKnitr\n\n\n```{python}\n#| label: fig-plot\n#| fig.cap: \"Plot\"\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1,23,2,4])\nplt.show()\n```\n\nFor example, see @fig-plot.\n\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-plot\n#| fig.cap: \"Plot\"\n\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nFor example, see @fig-plot.\n\n\n\nYou can also create multiple figures within a Jupyter code cell and reference them as subfigures. To do this use fig.cap for the main caption, and fig.subcap to provide an array of subcaptions. For example:\n```{python}\n#| label: fig-plots\n#| fig.cap: \"Plots\" \n#| fig.subcap:\n#|   - \"Plot 1\"\n#|   - \"Plot 2\" \n#| layout.ncol: 2\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1,23,2,4])\nplt.show()\n\nplt.plot([8,65,23,90])\nplt.show()\n```\n\nSee @fig-plots for examples.

    "text": "In Pandoc markdown, a figure is created whenever a captioned image appears by-itself in a paragraph. For example:\n![Elephant](elephant.png)\nThis results in the following treatment for various output types:\n\n\n\nHTML\nPDF\nWord\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that for LaTeX / PDF output figures are automatically numbered (you can arrange for figures to be numbered in other formats using Cross References).\n\nLinked Figures\nWhen rendering with Quarto, you can enclose a figure within a link and it will still be treated within output as a captioned figure. For example:\n[![Elephant](elephant.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)\n\n\nFigure Alignment\nFigures and their captions are center aligned by default. Add the fig.align attribute to the image to use a different alignment. For example:\n![Elephant](elephant.png){fig.align=\"left\"}\n\n\nAlt Text\nYou can add alternative text to a figure by adding the fig.alt attribute to the image. For example, the following Markdown…\n![](elephant.png){fig.alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\"}\n… will create the following HTML with the corresponding alt tag:\n<img src=\"elephant.png\" alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\">\nNote that the figure caption, title, and alt text can all be different. For example, the following code…\n![Elephant](elephant.png \"Title: An elephant\"){fig.alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\"}\n…produces this HTML:\n<img src=\"elephant.png\" title=\"Title: An elephant\" alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\">\n\n\nLaTeX Environments\nThere are a number of LaTeX packages that provide custom figure environments. For example, the mdframed package includes an mdframed environment used to enclose figures in a special border style. By default, Quarto uses the standard figure environment, but you can use the fig.env attribute to specify a custom one. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"Sidenotes\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    header-includes: |\n      \\usepackage{sidenotes}\n---\n\n![Elephant](elephant.png){fig.env=\"marginfigure\"}"

You can therefore use whatever scheme is most natural. For example, here we define columns that occupy varying percentage widths of the row:\n::: {layout=\"[[70,30], [100]]\"}\n![Surus](surus.png)\n\n![Hanno](hanno.png)\n\n![Lin Wang](lin-wang.png)\n:::\nYou can also use negative values to create space between elements.

    "section": "Code Execution",
    "text": "Rendering a list of input files has the potential to be quite time consuming depending on the computations required. There are a number of techniques you can use to minimize the time required to rebuild a site that has expensive computations.\n\nFreeze\nYou can use the freeze option to denote that computational documents should never be re-rendered during a global project render, or alternatively only be re-rendered when their source file changes:\nexecute:\n  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render\nexecute:\n  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes\nNote that freeze controls whether execution occurs during global project renders. If you do an incremental render of either a single document or a project sub-directory then code is always executed. For example:\n# render single document (always executes code)\nquarto render document.qmd\n\n# render project subdirectory (always executes code)\nquarto render articles\n\nUsing Freeze\nFreeze is generally used when you have either a large number of collaborators or many computational documents created over a longer period of time. In both cases it can be challenging to fully re-execute every document when you render the site. This could be because some documents have esoteric or environment-specific requirements (e.g. require access/authentication to a data source) or due to general fragility of dependencies over time. Using freeze ensures that you can always reproducibly render your site.\nThe computational results of documents executed with freeze are stored in the _freeze directory, and re-used when needed to fulfill document renders. You should check the contents of _freeze into version control so that others rendering the project don’t need to reproduce your computational environment to render it in their environment.\n\n\nVirtual Environments\nYou can also combine freeze with the use of virtual environments to divide your project into sub-directories that each have their own set of dependencies. This allows multiple collaborators to use a set of localized dependencies for the documents they are responsible for, but at the same time still be able to render the entire project without requiring all of it’s dependencies.\nTo learn how to create and use a virtual environment, see the documentation on Virtual Environments below.\nHere’s an example workflow of using virtual environments with freeze:\n\nInclude freeze: true in the project execution options:\nexecute:\n  freeze: true\nCreate a sub-directory of documents (e.g. research), and initialize and use a virtual environment within it:\nresearch/\n  document1.qmd\n  document2.qmd\n  env/\n  requirements.txt\nWhen working wihtin this sub-directory, activate the virtual environment before rendering it’s documents. For example:\ncd research\nsource venv/bin/activate\nquarto render               # render all files in subdir\nquarto render document.qmd  # render a single-file\n\nThis sub-directory render won’t use the cached freeze results but instead will re-run all of the computations using the directory-specific virtual environment. You can of course also include sub-directories within this directory and their documents will also be rendered using the parent virtual environment.\n\n\n\nCache\nYou can use the cache option to cache the results of computations (using the knitr cache for R documents, and Jupyter Cache for Jupyter documents):\nexecute:\n  cache: true\nNote that cache invalidation is triggered by changes in chunk source code (or other cache attributes you’ve defined). You may however need to manually refresh the cache if you know that some other input (or even time) has changed sufficiently to warrant an update. To do this, render either individual files or an entire project using the --cache-refresh option:\nquarto render mydoc.qmd --cache-refresh # single doc\nquarto render --cache-refresh           # entire project\n\n\nNotebooks\nNote that when rendering an .ipynb Quarto will not execute the cells within the notebook by default (the presumption being that you already executed them while editing the notebook). If you want to execute the cells you can pass the --execute flag to render:\nquarto render jupyter-document.ipynb --execute\nYou can also specify this behavior within the notebook’s YAML front matter:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nexecute: true\njupyter: python3\n---\n\n\nWorking Dir\nBy default, the working directory for rendering files within a project is the directory of the file itself. If you prefer to use the main project directory instead, you can add the execute-dir: project option to your config:\nproject:\n  execute-dir: project\nNote that from within your code you can always determine the location of the currently executing Quarto project using the QUARTO_PROJECT_DIR environment variable."

This both helps you to faithfully reproduce your environment (e.g. if you are collaborating with a colleague or deploying to a server) as well as isolate the use of packages so that upgrading a package in one project doesn’t break other projects.\nThere are several popular flavors of virtual environment, we will cover the following ones here:\n\nvenv (built into Python 3)\nconda (built in to Anaconda/Miniconda)\nrenv (package for managing R environments)\n\nBelow we’ll provide some example workflows for using these tools with Quarto. In these examples we’ll assume that you are already within a project directory that contains Quarto documents (so the environment will be created as a sub-directory of the project).\nWe’ll also cover using virtual environments with JupyterLab and RStudio.\n\nUsing venv\nHere we’ll provide a brief run through of creating a venv for a Quarto project. See the full documentation on using virtual environments with Python for additional details.\nTo create a new Python 3 virtual environment in the directory env:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nWindows\npy -m venv env\n\n\nMac/Linux\npython3 -m venv env\n\n\n\nTo use the environment you need to activate it. This differs slightly depending on which platform / shell you are using:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShell\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n(Command)\nenv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n\n\nWindows\n(PowerShell)\nenv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n\n\nMac/Linux\nsource env/bin/activate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowerShell Note\n\n\n\nNote that you may receive an error about running scripts being disabled when activating within PowerShell. If you get this error then execute the following command:\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser\n\n\nOnce you’ve activated the environment, you need to ensure that you have the packages required to render your documents. This will typically encompass jupyter / jupyterlab plus whatever other packages are used in your Python code. ip to install packages into your environment. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nWindows\npy -m pip install matplotlib pandas\n\n\nMac/Linux\npython3 -m pip install matplotlib pandas\n\n\n\nAssuming you installed all of the required packages (likely more than just pandas and matplotlib) you should now be able to quarto render documents within the directory.\nTo deactivate an environment use the deactivate command:\ndeactivate\n\nSaving Environments\nTo make your environment reproducible, you need to create a requirements.txt file that enumerates all of the packages in use. To do this use the pip freeze command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nWindows\npy -m pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n\nMac/Linux\npython3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n\n\nYou should generally check the requirements.txt file into version control.\n\n\nRestoring Environments\nTo reproduce the environment on another machine you create an empty environment, activate it, and then pip install using requirements.txt:\nFirst, follow the instructions above for creating and activating a virtual environment for your platform/shell.\nThen, install packages from requirements.txt:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nWindows\npy -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\nMac/Linux\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing conda\nThis section will cover the basics of creating and using conda environments with Quarto projects. See this article on managing project specific environments with Conda for additional details.\nTo create a new environment in the directory env:\nconda create --prefix env python\nIf this is the first time you’ve used conda in your shell, you may need to execute one of the following commands before using other conda tools:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShell\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n(Command)\nconda init cmd.exe\n\n\nWindows\n(PowerShell)\nconda init powershell\n\n\nLinux / Older Mac\n(Bash)\nconda init bash\n\n\nNewer Mac\n(Zsh)\nconda init zsh\n\n\n\nYou will likely need to exit and restart your terminal for conda init to be reflected in your session.\nTo use the environment you need to activate it, which you do as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nWindows\nconda activate .\\env\n\n\nMac/Linux\nconda activate ./env\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve activated the environment, you need to ensure that you have the packages required to render your documents. This will typically encompass jupyter / jupyterlab plus whatever other packages are used in your Python code. Use conda install to install packages into your environment. For example:\nconda install jupyterlab\nconda install pandas matplotlib \nAssuming you installed all of the required packages (likely more than just pandas and matplotlib) you should now be able to quarto render documents within the directory.\nUse conda deactivate to exit an activated environment:\nconda deactivate\n\nSaving Environments\nTo make your environment reproducible, you need to create a environment.yml file that enumerates all of the packages in use. Do this using the conda env export command:\nconda env export > environment.yml\nYou should generally check the environment.yml file into version control.\n\n\nRestoring Environments\nTo reproduce the environment on another machine you just pass the environment.yml file as an argument to conda create:\nconda create --prefix env -f environment.yml\n\n\n\nUsing renv\nThe renv package provides functionality similar to the venv and conda, but for R packages. To create a new renv environment, install the renv package from GitHub then call the renv::init() function:\nremotes::install(\"rstudio/renv\")\nrenv::init()\nAs part of initialization, your .Rprofile file is modified to ensure that the renv is activated automatically at the start of each R session.\nIf you plan on using both R and Python in your project, you can have renv automatically create and manage a Python virtual environment as follows:\nrenv::use_python()\nTo install R packages use the standard R install.packages function. You can also install GitHub packages using the renv::install function. For example:\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")      # install from CRAN\nrenv::install(\"tidyverse/dplyr\") # install from GitHub\nTo install Python packages just use pip as described above from the built-in RStudio terminal.\n\nSaving Environments\nTo record the current versions of all R (and optionally Python) packages, use the renv::snapshot() function:\nrenv::snapshot()\nThis will record an renv.lock file for R packages and a requirements.txt file for Python packages). These files should be checked into version control.\n\n\nRestoring Environments\nTo reproduce the environment on another machine use the renv::restore() function:\nrenv::restore()\n\n\n\nJupyterLab\nTo use Jupyter or JupyterLab within a Python virtual environment you just need to activate the environment and then launch the Jupyter front end. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShell\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n(Command)\nenv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\npy -m jupyter lab\n\n\nWindows (PowerShell)\nenv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\npy -m jupyter lab\n\n\nMac/Linux\nsource env/bin/activate\npython3 -m jupyter lab\n\n\n\nAll of the Python packages installed within the env will be available in your Jupyter notebook session. The workflow is similar if you are using conda environments.\n\n\nRStudio\nIf you are using RStudio with Quarto, it is strongly recommended that you run the daily build of RStudio v1.5, as it has many small improvements required to handle Quarto documents correctly.\nFor virtual environments in particular, you should make sure you are using version 1.5.122 or higher. You can download the daily build at https://dailies.rstudio.com.\n\nrenv\nIf you are using renv, RStudio v1.5 will automatically do the right thing in terms of binding Quarto to the R and/or Python packages in your project-local environments.\nIf you need to install R packages ust use install.packages; if you need to install Python packages simply use pip or conda within the Terminal as described above.\n\n\nvenv / condaenv\nStarting with version 1.5.122, RStudio will automatically activate any venv or condaenv that it finds within a project directory. Just be sure to create an RStudio project within the same directory where you created your env and things will work as expected with no additional configuration.\nIf you need to install Python packages simply use pip or conda within the Terminal as described above."

Even so, we still recommend that you install a version of Python 3 using the standard installer at https://www.python.org/downloads/.\n\n\nOn Windows, Quarto will use Conda if it’s invoked within an activated Conda environment. Otherwise, it will use the Python Windows Launcher to select a version of Python 3. Use the PY_PYTHON environment variable to override the default behavior (for example: PY_PYTHON=3.8).\nThe quarto check jupyter command will tell you which version of Python will be selected for the shell it is invoked from within.\n\n\n\nKnitr\nTo use Quarto with R, you should install the quarto R package:\ninstall.packages(\"quarto\")\nInstallation of the quarto package will also install the knitr package so you will have everything required to render documents containing R code.

Hiding some or all code that was executed by [Knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr) or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).\n2.  Code folding for executed code (hidden by default and expandable by readers).\n3.  View the source code of the markdown file used to generate the document.\n4.  Syntax highlighting themes and other options to control the appearance of code.\n5.  Copy to clipboard button for code blocks.\n6.  Generating hyperlinks to online documentation for functions used within code blocks via the [downlit](https://downlit.r-lib.org/) package (note that this option currently only works when using the Knitr engine).\n\nDetails on using all of these options are provided below.\n\n## Hiding Code\n\nFor many documents you may want to hide all of the executable source code used to produce dynamic outputs. You can do this by specifying `echo: false` in the document `execute` options. For example:\n\n``` {.yaml}\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nexecute:\n  echo: false\njupyter: python3\n---\n```\n\nNote that we can override this option on a per code-block basis. For example:\n\n```` {.markdown}\n```{python}`r ''`\n#| echo: true\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1,2,3,4])\nplt.show()\n```\n````\n\nCode block options are included in a special comment at the top of the block (lines at the top prefaced with `#|` are considered options).\n\n## Folding Code\n\nUse the `code-fold` option to include code but have it hidden by default using the HTML `<details>` tag. For example, click the **Code** button to see the code that produced this plot.\n\n```{r}\n#| fold: true\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndat <- data.frame(cond = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each=10),\n                  xvar = 1:20 + rnorm(20,sd=3),\n                  yvar = 1:20 + rnorm(20,sd=3))\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x=xvar, y=yvar)) +\n    geom_point(shape=1) + \n    geom_smooth() \n```\n\nHere we specify both `code-fold: true` as well as custom summary text (the default is just \"Code\" as shown above):\n\n``` {.yaml}\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n    code-summary: \"Show the code\"\n```\n\nValid values for `code-fold` include:\n\n| Value   | Behavior                     |\n|---------|------------------------------|\n| `false` | No folding (default)         |\n| `true`  | Fold code (initially hidden) |\n| `show`  | Fold code (initially shown)  |\n\nUse the `fold` and `summary` chunk attributes to control this on a chunk-by-chunk basis:\n\n```` {.python}\n```{r}`r ''`\n#| fold: true\n#| summary: \"Show the code\"\n\n```\n````\n\n## Code Tools\n\nYou can include a **Code** menu in the header of your document that provides various tools for readers to interact with the source code. Specify `code-tools: true` to activate these tools:\n\n``` {.yaml}\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n    code-tools: true\n```\n\nIf you have a document that includes folded code blocks then the **Code** menu will present options to show and hide the folded code as well as view the full source code of the document:\n\n![](images/code-tools-01.png){.border}\n\nThis document specifies `code-tools: true` in it's options so you should see the **Code** menu above next to the main header.\n\nYou can control which of these options are made available as well as the \"Code\" caption text using sub-options of `code-tools`. For example, here we specify that we want only \"View Source\" (no toggling of code visibility) and no caption on the code menu:\n\n``` {.yaml}\nformat:\n  html: \n    code-tools:\n      source: true\n      toggle: false\n      caption: none\n```\n\nBy default, the source code is embedded in the document and shown in a popup window like this:\n\n![](images/code-tools-source.png)\n\nYou can alternatively specify a URL for the value of `source`:\n\n``` {.yaml}\nformat:\n  html: \n    code-tools:\n      source: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/blob/main/index.md\n```\n\nIf you are within a project and have specified a `repo-url` option then you can just use `repo` and the correct link to your source file will be generated:\n\n``` {.yaml}\nformat:\n  html: \n    code-tools:\n      source: repo\n```\n\n## Appearance\n\nBy default code blocks are rendered with a left border whose color is derived from the currently theme. You can customize code chunk appearance with some simple options that control the background color and left border. Options can either be booleans to enable or disable the treatment or can be legal CSS color strings (or they could even be SASS variable names!).\n\nHere is the default appearance for code blocks (`code-background: true`):\n\n![](images/code-bg.png)\n\nYou can instead use a left border treatment using the `code-border-left` option:\n\n``` {.yaml}\ncode-border-left: true\n```\n\n![](images/code-default.png)\n\nYou can combine a background and border treatment as well as customize the left border color:\n\n``` {.yaml}\ncode-background: true\ncode-border-left: \"#31BAE9\"\n```\n\n![](images/code-custom.png)\n\n## Highlighting\n\nYou can specify the code highlighting style using `highlight-style` and specifying one of the supported themes. Supported themes include all the themes included in Pandoc:\n\n-   pygments\n-   tango\n-   espresso\n-   zenburn\n-   kate\n-   monochrome\n-   breezedark\n-   haddock\n\nAs well as an additional set of extended themes including:\n\n-   arrow\n-   atom-one\n-   ayu\n-   breeze\n-   dracula\n-   github\n-   gruvbox\n-   mokokai\n-   nord\n-   oblivion\n-   printing\n-   radical\n-   solarized\n-   vim-dark\n\nFor example:\n\n``` {.yaml}\nhighlight-style: github\n```\n\nHighlighting themes can provide either a single highlighting definition or two definitions, one optimized for a light colored background and another optimized for a dark color background.

You can include a custom 404 page in a Quarto website by creating a markdown file named 404.md in the root of your project. For example:\n---\ntitle: Page Not Found\n---\n\nThe page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).\n\nYou may want to try searching to find the page's new location.\nNote that you can use HTML alongside markdown within your 404.md file in order to get exactly the appearance and layout you want.\nYour 404 page will appear within the chrome of your site (e.g. fonts, css, layout, navigation, etc.). This is so that users don’t feel that they’ve irrecoverably “left” your site when they get a 404 error. If you don’t want this behavior, then provide a 404.html rather than 404.md.\nHere are some examples of how various popular websites handle custom 404 pages: https://blog.fluidui.com/top-404-error-page-examples/.\n\nSite Path Configuration\nIf your website is served from the root of a domain (e.g. https://example.com/) then simply providing a 404.md file as described above is all that’s required to create a custom 404 page.\nHowever, if your website is not served from the root of a domain then you need to provide one additional bit of configuration to make sure that resources (e.g. your site’s CSS) are resolved correctly within 404 pages.\nFor example, if your site is served from https://example.com/mysite/ then you’d add the following to your project site configuration within _quarto.yml:\nsite:\n  title: \"My Site\"\n  site-path: \"/mysite/\"\nNote that if you are already providing a site-url (which is required for generation of sitemaps and social metadata preview images) then it’s enough to simply include the path within the site-url:\nsite:\n  title: \"My Site\"\n  site-url: \"https://example.com/mysite/\""

For more information about how Quarto finds preview images, see Preview Images.\nYou may also provide additional metadata to be used when generating the Open Graph metadata, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntitle\nThe title of the content. Quarto will automatically use the title metadata from the page metadata. If you’d like you can override this just for the Open Graph metadata by including a title in the open-graph metadata.\n\n\ndescription\nA short description of the content. Quarto will automatically use the description metadata from the page metadata. If you’d like you can override this just for the Open Graph metadata by including a description in the open-graph metadata.\n\n\nimage\nThe path to a preview image for this content. By default, Quarto will use the image value from the site: metadata. If you provide an image, you may also optionally provide an image-width and image-height.\nIf image is not provided, Quarto will automatically attempt to locate a preview image. For more information, see Preview Images.\n\n\nlocale\nThe locale that the Open Graph metadata is marked up in.\n\n\nsite_name\nThe name which should be displayed for the overall site. If not explicitly provided in the open-graph metadata, Quarto will use the site:title value.\n\n\n\nHere is a more comprehensive example of specifying Open Graph metadata in a quarto.yml file:\nsite:\n  open-graph:\n    locale: es_ES\n    site_name: Quarto\nQuarto will automatically merge global metadata found in the site: open-graph key with any metadata provided in the document itself in the open-graph key. This is useful when need to specify a mix of global options (for example, site) with per document options such as title or image.\n\n\nPreview Images\nYou can specify a preview image for your article in several different ways:\n\nYou can explicitly provide a full url to the preview image using the image field in the appropriate metadata. For example:\ntitle: \"My Document\"\ntwitter-card:\n  image: \"https://quarto.org/images/preview-code.png\"\nYou may provide a document relative path to an image (such as images/preview-code.png) or a project relative path to an image (such as /images/preview-code.png). If you provide a relative path such as this, you must also provide a site-url in your site’s metadata. For example in your _quarto.yml configuration file:\nsite:\n  site-url: \"https://www.quarto.org\"\nand in your document front matter:\ntitle: \"My Document\"\ntwitter-card:\n  image: \"/images/preview-code.png\"\nAny image that is being rendered in the page may also be used as a preview image by giving it the class name preview-image. Quarto will select the first image it finds with this class. For example, the following image will be used as the preview image when included on a page:\n![](images/jupyter-document.png){.border .preview-image}\nIf you label an image with this class, you must also provide a site-url in your site’s metadata.\nIf none of the above ways of specifying a preview image have been used, Quarto will attempt to find a preview image by looking for an image included in the rendered document with one of the following names:\n\npreview\nfeature\ncover\nthumbail\n\nIf you rely in image names to provide a preview image, you must also provide a site-url in your site’s metadata."

If you choose to use cookies to store this user data, you should consider whether you need to enable Cookie Consent in order to permit the viewer to control any tracking that you enable.\nIf you choose none for storage, this will have the following effects:\n\nFor Google Analytics v3 (analytics.js)\nNo tracking cookies will be used. Individual page hits will be properly tracked, enabling you to see which pages are viewed and how often they are viewed. Unique user and session tracking will not report data correctly since the tracking cookies they rely upon are not set.\nFor Google Tags (gtag)\nUser consent for ad and analytics tracking cookies will be withheld. In this mode, Google Analytics will still collect user data without the user identification, but that data is currently not displayed in the Google Analytics reports."
