## Listings

- Listings now support `template-params`, which will be passed to custom EJS templates in a variable called `templateParams` when a listing is rendered.
- Custom listing objects now resolve `path: ` fields into the metadata that would be generated by standard listings, giving custom listing access to computed metadata like `reading-time`, etc.

- Allow listings in project to point directly to non-input files (such as `yml` files) to use for contents.

- Allow `sort: false` to disable any sorting, allowing items to appear in their original / natural order. (#3296)

- Add support for `includes:` and `excludes:` in listings, which will use filter the items included in a listing. ([#2577](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2577)).

## Websites


- Add support for overriding the url used to report an issue with a website using `issue-url` (which can be provided even if there is no repo provided for the website).

- Permit sidebar items to include icons ([#3830](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3830)).

## Books

- Non-HTML book output formats will now be placed in subdirectories (`book-<format>`) within the project output directory (`_books`)
- Support for rendering to Asciidoc
- Support for rendering to LaTeX

## LUA

- `quarto.version()` now returns `Version` object that simplifies comparison (thank you @tarleb)

## HTML Output

- Use `toc-expand` to control to what level the TOC will expand by default in HTML documents.

## Miscellaneous

- Add optional `rel` attribute to navigation links ([#3212](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3212))

- Allow custom themes for giscus ([#3105](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3105))


- the API for shortcode handlers in lua now accepts a fourth parameter `raw_args` which hold the unparsed arguments in a table ([#3833](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3833)).

- Support parsing markdown in table captions in LaTeX and HTML tables ([#2573](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2573)).


- Warn users about Chromium installation issues in WSL ([#4596](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4586)).

- Add `title` attribute for callouts (can be used rather than heading for defining the title)



## Other


- Extension authors may now force files to be included in their template by writing the file / file path in the `.quartoignore` file prefixed with a `!`. For example `!README.md` ([#4061](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4061)).
