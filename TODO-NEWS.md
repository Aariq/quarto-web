## Listings

- Listings now support `template-params`, which will be passed to custom EJS templates in a variable called `templateParams` when a listing is rendered.
- Custom listing objects now resolve `path: ` fields into the metadata that would be generated by standard listings, giving custom listing access to computed metadata like `reading-time`, etc.

- Allow listings in project to point directly to non-input files (such as `yml` files) to use for contents.

- Allow `sort: false` to disable any sorting, allowing items to appear in their original / natural order. (#3296)

- Add support for `includes:` and `excludes:` in listings, which will use filter the items included in a listing. ([#2577](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2577)).
