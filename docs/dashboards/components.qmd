## Overview

Dashboards are compositions of various components used to present data and provide navigation. Below we'll describe all of the available components in depth. 

See the [Dashboard Tutorial](tutorial.qmd) for a higher level review of how all of these components work together.

## Navigation

All dashboards include a top-level navigation bar that provides a logo, title, and optional author. Social and source code links can also be provided. Dashboards with multiple pages also contain a link to each page on the navigation bar. 

**TODO**: Screenshot of navigation bar

You can specify the `title` and `author` using their respective document options:

```yaml
---
title: "Palmer Penguins"
author: "Cobblepot Analytics"
---
```

**TODO**: Document logo, pages, buttons, etc.

**TODO**: Document changing background color, etc.

## Pages

- syntax for pages
- navigation bar

## Layout

Dashboards components are laid out using alternating sets of rows and columns. Rows and columns are in turn defined by markdown headings and computational cells. For example, here's a simple layout with two rows, where the second row is split into two columns:


::: {.chart-example .grid}

::: {.g-col-5}

````python
---
title: "Palmer Penguins"
author: "Cobblepot Analytics"
format: dashboard
---
    
## Row {height=70%}

```{{python}}
```

## Row {height=30%}

```{{python}}
```

```{{python}}
```
````

:::

::: {.g-col-7}

Here, level 2 markdown headings (e.g. `## Row {height=70%}`) define the contents of rows as well as their relative height. The ```` ```{python} ```` code cells in turn automatically create columns.

By default, dashboards a laid out first by row then by column (`orientation: rows`). However, you can change this by specifying the `orientation: columns` option:


::: {.chart-example .grid}

::: {.g-col-5}

````python
---
title: "Diamonds Explorer"
format: 
  dashboard:
    orientation: columns
---
    
## Column {width=60%}

```{{python}}
```

## Column {width=40%}

```{{python}}
```

```{{python}}
```
````

:::

::: {.g-col-7}

The article on [Dashboard Layouts](layouts.qmd) provides extensive additional example layouts which you can use as a basis for your own dashboards.


## Tabsets





## Cards

- padding
- title
- expandable

## Plots

- use some javascript!
- or, choose figure sizes very carefully!
- language specific

## Tables

- default treatment for tables (fixed headings, etc.)
- paged tables
- tbl-colwidths

## Value Boxes

- cell component syntax

::: {.valuebox icon="foo"}
My valuebox

## Text Content

- how can I get into my dashboards
- markdown cards
- .flow
::: {.card}
