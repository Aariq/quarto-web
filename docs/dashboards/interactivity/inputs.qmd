title: "Dashboard Input Layout"
--- 

## Overview

There are several ways to layout inputs within interactive dashboards:

- [Sidebars](#sidebars) provide a collapsible, full height panel for inputs.

- [Toolbars](#toolbars) provide a full page width horizontal panel for inputs.

- [Card Toolbars](#card-toolbars) are directly embedded in the header or footer of cards.

These techniques all create regions for inputs with a special background color to distinguish them from ordinary content. You can also locate inputs anywhere else you wish within a dashboard (i.e. in a standard card).
