title: "Input Layout for Dashboards"

## Overview

There are several ways to layout inputs within interactive dashboards:

- [Sidebars](#sidebars) provide a collapsible, full height panel for inputs.

- [Input Panels](#input-panels) provide a toolbar-style horizontal panel for inputs.

- [Card Inputs](#card-inputs) are directly embedded in the header or footer of cards.

These techniques all create regions for inputs with a special background color to distinguish them from ordinary content. You can also locate inputs anywhere else you wish within a dashboard (i.e. in a standard card). 


## Sidebars

Sidebars are a great place to group inputs for interactive dashboards. Within sidebars, input widgets are laid out top to bottom and occupy the full width of the sidebar.

To include a sidebar on a page, add the `.sidebar` class to a level 2 heading:

```` {.python .pymd}
---
title: "Sidebar"
format: dashboard
server: shiny
---
    
## {.sidebar}

```{{python}}
from shiny import ui
ui.input_select("x", "Variable:",   # <3>
                choices=["bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm"])
ui.input_select("dist", "Distribution:", choices=["hist", "kde"])
ui.input_checkbox("rug", "Show rug marks", value = False)  # <3>
```

## Column 

```{{python}}
from shiny import render
@render.plot
def displot():
    return sns.displot(
        data=penguins, hue="species", multiple="stack",
        x=input.x(), rug=input.rug(), kind=input.dist())
```
````

![](/docs/dashboards/images/shiny-simple.png){.border fig-alt="A screenshot of a Penguin Bills dashboard. A sidebar on the left contains two dropdown menus, one for Variable and one for Distribution and a checkbox to show rugmarks. On the right a plot occupies the full page height and shows a histogram of bill_length_mm colored by species."}

Note that sidebars can be shown and hidden using the button at the top right.

By default, sidebars have a width of 275px. You can change this by adding a `width` attribute to the `.sidebar` heading. For example:

````{.python .pymd}
## {.sidebar width="350px"}
````


### Global Sidebar

If you have a dashboard with [multiple pages](#pages), you may want the sidebar to be global (i.e. visible across all pages). To do this, add the `.sidebar` class to a level 1 heading:

```` {.python .pymd}
---
title: "Sidebar"
format: dashboard
server: shiny
---
    
# {.sidebar}

Sidebar content

# Plots

```{{python}}
```

# Data

```{{python}}
```
````

![](../images/penguins-shiny.png){.border fig-alt="Screenshot of a Palmer Penguins dashboard. Navigation bar shows two pages: Plots and Data. On the left is a sidebar with an image of penguins followed by four inputs: a set of checkboxes for Species; a set of checkboxes for Islands; and dropdown for Distribution; and a checkbox to show rug marks. On the right the page is divided into two rows each showing a density plot: the top row of bill_depth_mm; the bottom row of bill_length_mm"}


The above example also demonstrates that you can place arbitrary content within sidebars (narrative text, links, images, etc.). 

## Input Panels

Input panels are similar to sidebars, but provide a horizontal layout for inputs (more like a conventional toolbar). Here we adapt the first example from above to use an input panel rather than sidebar:


```` {.python .pymd}
---
title: "Input Panel"
format: dashboard
server: shiny
---
    
```{{python}}
#| content: inputs
from shiny import render, ui
ui.input_select("x", "Variable:",
                choices=["bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm"])
ui.input_select("dist", "Distribution:", choices=["hist", "kde"])
ui.input_checkbox("rug", "Show rug marks", value = False)
```
    
````

## Card Inputs

You can also attach inputs directly to a card. Here we adapt the input panel from above to be a header for the next card:

````{.python .pymd}
```{{python}}
#| content: inputs
#| header-for: next
from shiny import render, ui
ui.input_select("x", "Variable:",
                choices=["bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm"])
ui.input_select("dist", "Distribution:", choices=["hist", "kde"])
ui.input_checkbox("rug", "Show rug marks", value = False)
```
````

You can also attach inputs to the footer of a card using the `footer-for` option. The `header-for` and `footer-for` options can specify `next`, `previous`, or the `label` of any other cell.


## Column Layout

If you have a large number of inputs to present you may also want to take advantage of column layout to organize them visually.
