## Overview

Dashboards consist of the following components:

1)  **Navigation** --- Top level navigation bar that includes the title, author, and links to sub-pages (if more than one page is defined).

2)  **Layout** --- Dashboard layouts are created by combining _Rows_ and _Columns_, which are defined using markdown headings (with optional attributes to control height, width, etc.). _Tabsets_ can be used to further divide content within a row or column.

3)  **Cards** --- Cards are containers for data, visualizations, and free from content. The content of cards typically maps to *cells* in your notebook or source document.

4)  **Inputs** --- If you are are creating an interactive dashboard then there are additional components (sidebars and input panels) that are optimized for presenting input controls.
