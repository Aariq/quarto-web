If you want to include additional content in your document from another file, you can use the `include-in-*` options:

| Option                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `include-in-header`   | Include contents of *file*, verbatim, at the end of the header. This can be used, for example, to include special CSS or JavaScript in HTML documents or to inject commands into the LaTeX preamble.                                     |
| `include-before-body` | Include contents of *file*, verbatim, at the beginning of the document body (e.g.Â after the `<body>` tag in HTML, or the `\begin{document}` command in LaTeX). This can be used to include navigation bars or banners in HTML documents. |
| `include-after-body`  | Include contents of *file*, verbatim, at the end of the document body (before the `</body>` tag in HTML, or the `\end{document}` command in LaTeX).                                                                                      |

You can specify directly a single file or multiple files for each of these options (or use the `file:` subkey), but also use the `text` sub key to include raw content directly.  Note that `|` character needs to be used on the line with `text:` inside `include-in-*:` to indicate that the value is a multi-line string. If you omit `file:` or `text:`, Quarto assumes you meant a file.
