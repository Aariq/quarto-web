## Overview

By default Quarto documents center their content within the document viewport and provide a constrained body that is limited to around 900px wide. This behavior exists to optimize readability, but for pages that aren't documents or readability focused, you may want to use other layouts.

To do this, use the `page-layout` option to control the layout that will be used for the page. For example:

``` yaml
format: 
  html:
    page-layout: custom
```

## Options

The following page-layout options are available:

`article`

:   Article layout provides a content area with a page based grid layout that provides margins, areas for sidebars, and a reading width optimized body region in which the main content is displayed. The precise size of the document regions will vary slightly depending upon the sidebar (if present) and the presence or absence of margin or complex layout elements. To learn more about the article grid layout, see [Article Layout](../authoring/article-layout.qmd).

`full`

:   Full layout uses the article grid system, but will automatically expand the content area to use the sidebar and margin region if no content is placed within those regions. This is useful for layouts that don't need to be constrained to reading width and that will benefit from additional content width.

`custom`

:   Custom layout provides an HTML content container. This is useful when you'd like to create a page layout within a content container. In websites, custom layouts do no include navigation sidebars.

`none`

:   None provides no HTML content container. This is useful when you'd like to have full control of the page layout including controlling position to the edge of the viewport (e.g. full bleed). In websites, the `none` layout does not include navigation sidebars.
