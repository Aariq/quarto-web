title: "HTML w/ Bootstrap"
format: html

## Overview

There are a number of additional HTML output features that are available when you are using a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) based theme, including:

-   Floating TOC

-   Tabsets

-   Additional code block options

-   Responsive figures

::: {.callout-note}
Note that the `html` format uses a Bootstrap theme by default, so you don't need to do anything special to enable these features. If however you specify `theme: none` or `theme: pandoc` they will not be available.
:::

## Floating TOC

The HTML format by default uses a floating table of contents which can be customized using the following:

``` {.yaml}
format:
  html:
    toc: true
    toc-float: true
    toc-title: Contents
```

The floating table of contents can be used to navigate to sections of the document and also will automatically highlight the appropriate section as the user scrolls. The table of contents is responsive and will become hidden once the viewport becomes too narrow. See an example on the right of this page.

## Tabsets

You can use tabsets to present content that will vary in interest depending on the audience. For example, here we provide some example code in a variety of languages:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## R

``` {.r}
fizz_buzz <- function(fbnums = 1:50) {
  output <- dplyr::case_when(
    fbnums %% 15 == 0 ~ "FizzBuzz",
    fbnums %% 3 == 0 ~ "Fizz",
    fbnums %% 5 == 0 ~ "Buzz",
    TRUE ~ as.character(fbnums)
  )
  print(output)
}
```

## Python

``` {.python}
def fizz_buzz(num):
  if num % 15 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  elif num % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  elif num % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  else:
    print(num)
```

## Java

``` {.java}
public class FizzBuzz
{
  public static void fizzBuzz(int num)
  {
    if (num % 15 == 0) {
      System.out.println("FizzBuzz");
    } else if (num % 5 == 0) {
      System.out.println("Buzz");
    } else if (num % 3 == 0) {
      System.out.println("Fizz");
    } else {
      System.out.println(num);
    }
  }
}
```

## Julia

``` {.julia}
function FizzBuzz(num)
  if num % 15 == 0
    println("FizzBuzz")
  elseif num % 5 == 0
    println("Buzz")
  elseif num % 3 == 0
    println("Fizz")
  else
    println(num)
  end
end
```
:::

Create a tabset via a markdown div with the class name panel-tabset (e.g. `::: {.panel-tabset}`). Each top-level heading within the div creates a new tab. For example, here is the markdown used to implement the first two tabs displayed above:

```` {.markdown}
::: {.panel-tabset}
## R

``` {.r}
fizz_buzz <- function(fbnums = 1:50) {
  output <- dplyr::case_when(
    fbnums %% 15 == 0 ~ "FizzBuzz",
    fbnums %% 3 == 0 ~ "Fizz",
    fbnums %% 5 == 0 ~ "Buzz",
    TRUE ~ as.character(fbnums)
  )
  print(output)
}
```

## Python

``` {.python}
def fizz_buzz(num):
  if num % 15 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  elif num % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  elif num % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  else:
    print(num)
```

## Code Blocks

By default code blocks are rendered with a left border whose color is derived from the currently theme. You can customize code chunk appearance with some simple options that control the background color and left border. Options can either be booleans to enable or disable the treatment or can be legal CSS color strings (or they could even be SASS variable names!).

### Appearance

Here is the default appearance for code blocks (note the border at left and no background highlighting):

![](images/code-default.png)

You can add a background using the `code-background` option:

``` {.yaml}
code-background: true
```

![](images/code-bg.png)

You can combine a background and border treatment as well as customize the left border color:

``` {.yaml}
code-background: true
code-border-left: "#31BAE9"
```

![](images/code-custom.png)

### Highlighting

You can specify the code highlighting style using `highlight-style` and specifying one of the supported themes. Supported themes include all the themes included in Pandoc (pygments, tango, espresso, zenburn, kate, monochrome, breezedark, haddock) as well as an additional set of extended themes here:

<https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/src/resources/pandoc/highlight-styles>

For example:

``` {.yaml}
highlight-style: github
```

Highlighting themes can provide either a single highlighting definition or two definitions, one optimized for a light colored background and another optimized for a dark color background. When available, Quarto will automatically select the appropriate style based upon the code chunk background color's darkness. Users may always opt to specify the full name (e.g. `atom-one-dark`) to by pass this automatic behavior.

By default, code is highlighted using the `arrow` theme. We've additionally introduced the `arrow-dark` theme which is designed to provide beautiful, accessible highlighting against dark backgrounds.

Examples of the light and dark themes:

#### Arrow (light)

![](images/arrow.png)

#### Arrow (dark)

![](images/arrow-dark.png)

#### Ayu (light)

![](images/ayu.png)

#### Ayu (dark)

## Responsive Figures

If an image does not include an explicitly set height, it will automatically become responsive. Try resizing the browser and note how the image below grows and shrinks.

```{r pressure}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

library(ggplot2)
dat <- data.frame(cond = rep(c("A", "B"), each=10),
                  xvar = 1:20 + rnorm(20,sd=3),
                  yvar = 1:20 + rnorm(20,sd=3))

ggplot(dat, aes(x=xvar, y=yvar)) +
    geom_point(shape=1) + 
    geom_smooth() 
```
