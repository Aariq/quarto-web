## Overview

Quarto makes it easy to create a simple about page for an individual or organization. When the `about` option is provided for a document, a special template will be used to layout the content of the current page with a custom layout designed to present a person or organization.

For example:

``` markdown
---
title: "Finley Malloc"
about:
  template: jolla
  image: profile.jpg
  links:
    - icon: twitter
      text: twitter
      href: https://twitter.com
    - icon: github
      text: Github
      href: https://github.com
---

Finley Malloc is the Chief Data Scientist at Wengo Analytics. When not innovating on data platforms, Finley enjoys spending  time unicycling and playing with her pet iguana.

The contents of this page will be laid out using the `jolla` template with the `profile.png` image, and generate a set of links for the items specified in `links`.

You can write and format the content of the page however you'd like - when the page is rendered, Quarto will use the content and options provided in the `about` option to create the about page, arranging the content content of the `about` option with the content in the page itself.

## Templates

Quarto includes 5 built in templates, drawing inspiration from the [Postcards R Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/postcards/readme/README.html). Built in templates include:

-   `jolla`
-   `trestles`
-   `solana`
-   `marquee`
-   `broadside`

Each template will position the about elements with the content in a different layout. Select the template using the `template` option:

``` yaml
about:
  template: trestles
```

Here is a preview of each of the templates:

::: panel-tabset
### jolla

![](images/about-jolla.png){.border}

### trestles

![](images/about-trestles.png){.border}

### solana

![](images/about-solana.png){.border}

### marquee

![](images/about-marquee.png){.border}

### broadside

### Image

The image for the about page will be read from the document-level `image` option:

``` yaml
title: Finley Malloc
image: profile.jpg
about:
  template: jolla
```

In addition, you can customize how the image is displayed in the page to better meet your needs by setting the following options.

| option        | description                                                                           | templates                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| `image-width` | A valid CSS width for your image.                                                     | all                           |
| `image-shape` | The shape of the image on the about page. Choose from:`rectangle`, `round`, `rounded` | `jolla`, `solana`, `trestles` |

For example:

``` yaml
title: Finley Malloc
image: profile.png
about:
  template: trestles
  image-width: 10em
  image-shape: round
```

### Links

Your about page also may contain a set of links to other resources about you or your organization. Each template will render these links in a slightly different way. Here are the options that you can specify for each link:

| Option       | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `href`       | Link to file contained with the project or an external URL.                                                                                                 |
| `text`       | Text to display for navigation item (defaults to the document `title` if not provided).                                                                     |
| `icon`       | Name of one of the standard [Bootstrap 5 icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) (e.g. "github", "twitter", "share", etc.).                                 |
| `aria-label` | [Accessible label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute) for the navigation item. |
