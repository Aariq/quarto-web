title: "Distributing Extensions"
---

You can install an extension using the `quarto install extension` command. For example, the command:

`quarto install extension quarto-ext/fontawesome`

will install the `fontawesome` extension from the `quarto-ext` organization.

### Installing From Github

The most common way to get extensions is to install them from the Github repository that hosts them. To install an extension from Github, just use the command

`quarto install extension <gh-organization>/<gh-repo>`

For example, the repository at <https://github.com/quarto-ext/latex-environment> provides a simple way to emit LaTeX environments when making PDFs. To install this extension, you would use the command

`quarto install extension quarto-ext/latex-environment`

### Installing From a URL

Quarto extensions can also be installed directly from a URL. For example, the command:

`quarto install extension https://www.quarto-sample.com/extension.zip`

Would install the extension at the url you provided. This isn't typically necessary, but might be useful if the extension is not being hosted on Github.

### Installation Location

By default, extensions are installed for the directory in which you run the `install extension` command. This will make the extensions available to any documents that are directly within that folder (but not subfolders)

If you run the `install extension` command directly from within a project directory, the extensions will be installed in the project root and will be available to any document within that project directory. If you run the `install extension` command from a project subfolder, you will be asked whether to install extensions for the whole project or just for this folder. If you install an extensions for a subfolder, documents within that folder will only use extensions available in the subfolder and will not use project extensions.

Extension that are installed will be placed in an `_extensions` directory. That directory and its contents should be checked into source control if you are using source control.

Quarto extensions are always copied into the project or directory that you install them into (and not kept in a global location). This is done so that your project or document will always have access to the specific extensions that you used to render them, making the output more consistently reproducible.
