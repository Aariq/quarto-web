Quarto Extensions are a powerful way to modify and extend the behavior of Quarto. If you are using or developing extensions it is **strongly recommended** that you [update to Quarto v1.2](https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html), as it includes many enhancements to the extension API. Extensions listed below are also likely to require Quarto v1.2 or higher.

Check out the article on [Developing Extensions](index-prev.qmd) to learn how to develop your own extensions. If you have developed an extension and would like it listed here, see the article on [Distributing Extensions](distributing.qmd). For details on installing, updating, and removing extensions see [Managing Extensions](managing.qmd).
