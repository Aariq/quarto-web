For an overview of Quarto extensions, see [the overview](index.qmd) of Quarto Extensions.

## Extension Structure

Quarto extensions are conceptually very simple, though powerful. An extension is a bundle of metadata and resources that is made available to Quarto during the rendering of a document.

## Shortcode Extension

1.  Create an `_extensions` directory.

2.  Within the `_extensions` directory, create a folder with the name of your organization.

3.  Within the `organization` folder, create a folder with the name of your extension.
