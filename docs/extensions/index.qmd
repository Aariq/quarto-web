## Overview

Quarto Extensions provide additional features on top of the core Quarto feature set. Extensions are a powerful way to modify or extend the behavior of Quarto, and can be created and distributed by anyone. There are two types of extensions available:

-   [Shortcodes](shortcodes.qmd) are special markdown directives that generate various types of content. For example, you could create shortcodes to embed tweets or videos in a document.

-   [Filters](filters.qmd) are a flexible and powerful tool for introducing new global behaviors and/or new markdown rendering behaviors. For example, you could create filters to implement output folding, an image carousel, or just about anything you can imagine!

Here are some examples of extensions developed and maintained by the core Quarto team:

| **Extension**                                                        | **Description**                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [code-filename](https://github.com/quarto-ext/code-filename)         | Add a filename header to code blocks                                                            |
| [fancy-text](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fancy-text)               | Output nicely formatted versions of fancy strings such as LaTeX and BibTeX in multiple formats. |
| [fontawesome](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome)             | Use Font Awesome icons in HTML and PDF documents.                                               |
| [grouped-tabsets](https://github.com/quarto-ext/grouped-tabsets)     | Add grouped tabsets, which remember the active tab across multiple HTML documents.              |
| [latex-environment](https://github.com/quarto-ext/latex-environment) | Quarto extension to output custom LaTeX environments.                                           |

This articles covers the basics of installing and using extensions. The articles on [Creating Shortcodes](shortcodes.qmd) and [Creating Filters](filters.qmd) cover how to create your own extensions.

### Extension Trust

It's important to note that Quarto extensions may execute code when documents are rendered. If you do not trust the authors of an extension, we recommend that you do not install or use the extension.
:::

## Installation

If you want to use an extension within a document or project you need to install it. Rather than installing into a global library, Quarto extensions are installed locally, directly alongside the document or project they are used within. For example, if you have a project in a directory named `myblog`, you could install some extensions for use with that the project as follows:

``` bash
cd myblog
quarto install extension quarto-ext/fontawesome
quarto install extension quarto-ext/grouped-tabsets
```

This will result in an `_extensions` folder being created at the root of your project, and the `fontawesome` and `grouped-tabsets` extensions being installed within it.

Note that a project isn't strictly required for using extensions---if you install into a directory that isn't a project then any document located directly alongside the `_extensions` folder can use the extensions.

### Extensions and Version Control

If you are using version control you should check the `_extensions` directory in to your repo along with your other code. Installed extensions are treated as source code for your project to ensure very long term reproducibility---your project doesn't need to rely on the availability of an external package manager (or the maintenance of older extension versions) to successfully render now and far into the future.
:::

### Repositories

These extensions in the example above were prefixed with `quarto-ext` because they were distributed from the [quarto-ext](https://github.com/quarto-ext/) GitHub organization. Extensions can be similarly distributed from **any** GitHub organization. So for example the following might also be valid extension installation commands:

``` bash
quarto install extension cooltools/lightbox
quarto install extension bigstateu/fancytweet
```

While its convenient to distribute extensions using GitHub, you can also dstribute them as an ordinary gzip archive which can be installed from a URL or a local file. See the article on [Distributing Extensions](distributing.qmd) for additional details.

### Managing Extensions

The are several commands available for listing, updating, and removing extensions:

``` bash
quarto list extensions
quarto update extension quarto-ext/fontawesome
quarto remove extension quarto-ext/fontawesome
```

Note that when updating an extension you'll be prompted to confirm the update based on the version you have and the version you are attempting to update to.

If you run the `quarto remove extension` command with no `extension-id`, you will be presented with a list of extensions that are installed and you may select which extensions to remove.

## Using Shortcodes

Shortcodes are special markdown directives that generate various types of content. Quarto shortcodes are similar in form and function to [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) and [WordPress shortcodes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode).

For example, the following shortcode prints the `title` from document metadata:

``` {.markdown shortcodes="false"}
{{< meta title >}}
```

The `meta` shortcode is built-in to Quarto. Extensions can provide additional shortcodes. For example, the [`quarto-ext/fontawesome`](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome) extension provides the `fa` shortcode which enables you to use icons from [Font Awesome Free](https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free) within HTML and PDF documents.

You can use the `fa` shortcode by first installing it:

`quarto install extension quarto-ext/fontawesome`

Then using it within a document as follows:

``` markdown
---
title: My Awesome Document
---

## Section

This document uses Font Awesome {{{< fa smile >}}}.
```

## Using Filters

Filters provided by extensions need to be explicitly included in the list of `filters` used to render a document.

To use a filter extension, first install the extension using `quarto install extension`:

``` bash
quarto install extension quarto-ext/latex-environments
```

Then, add the extension name to the list of `filters` for your document or project:

``` markdown
---
title: My Environments Document
format:
  pdf: default
filters:
  - latex-environments
environments: [program]
---

:::{.program}
The contents of this div will be output in a `program`
latex environment, but will appear in HTML (and any other output 
format as a simple div with the class `program`)
:::
```

Note that if you have installed two filters with the same name you can further qualify them using the organization name, for example:

``` yaml
filters:
  - quarto-ext/latex-environments
```

## Learning More

Here are some possible steps for learning more about Quarto extensions:

-   The [Quarto Extensions](https://github.com/quarto-ext/) GitHub organization provides a set of extensions developed by the core Quarto team. Many of these extensions implement frequently requested features, and all of them provide sound examples of how to implement extensions.

-   [Creating Shortcodes](shortcodes.qmd) describes how to implement your own shortcode extensions.

-   [Creating Filters](filters.qmd) describes how to implement your own filter extensions.

-   [Developing with Lua](lua.qmd) helps you get started with Lua (the language used to create extensions) and provides documentation for Quarto Lua functions useful for extensions.

-   [Distributing Extensions](distributing.qmd) goes into more depth on how to package and distribute extensions, both on GitHub and using plain gzip archives.
