## Overview

When you introduce interactive components into a document you'll want to be sure to lay them out in a fashion that optimizes for readability and navigation.

There are of course a wide variety of ways you can incorporate interactivity spanning from visualizations embedded within a longer-form article all the way up to a more application/dashboard style layout. We'll cover both of these layout scenarios below.

We'll use examples from both [JavaScript](js/) and [Shiny](shiny/) interactive documents---if you aren't familiar with the code/syntax used for a given example just focus on the enclosing layout markup rather than the application code.

## Articles

When using interactive components inside an article, it's often optimal to lay out inputs directly above or below the main component. If there is only a single input the source code might be as simple as the input and output surrounded by markdown narrative. Here's a simple Shiny example to illustrate:

```` markdown
## Old Faithful

Data on eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. The data was collected continuously from August 1st until August 15th, 1985.

```{r}
sliderInput("bins", "Number of bins:", min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)
plotOutput("distPlot")
```

The data consists of 299 pairs of measurements, referring to the time interval between the starts of successive eruptions and the duration of the subsequent eruption.
````

Which would look like this when running:

### Input Panel

If you have several inputs, you may want to group them inside an input panel (div with class `.panel-input`). For example, here's a document containing a JavaScript map visualization with three inputs to control it:

![](images/article-input-panel-columns.png)

The inputs are grouped in a panel and laid out in three columns using the following markup:

1.  A div with class `.panel-input` provides the background color and border treatment.
2.  Adding the `layout-ncol=3` to the div lays out the input horizontally.

Here's the source code for the input panel:

```` {.python .ojs-example}
::: {.panel-input layout-ncol=3}

```{}
viewof ch = checkbox({
  title: "Passport color:",
  options: [
    { value: "red", label: "Red" },
    { value: "green", label: "Green" },
    { value: "blue", label: "Blue" },
    { value: "black", label: "Black" }
  ],
  value: ["red", "green", "blue", "black"],
  submit: false
})
```

```{}
viewof type = radio({
  title: "Representation:",
  options: [
    { label: 'Passports', value: 'p' },
    { label: 'Circles', value: 'c' }
  ],
  value: 'p'
})
```

```{}
viewof k = slider({
  title: "Symbol size:",
  min: 1,
  max: 10,
  value: 3,
  step: 1
})
```

See the [Passports & Colors](js/examples/passeports-colors.qmd) example for the full source code of this document.

### Tabset Panel

If you want to allow users to toggle between multiple visualizations, use a tabset (div with class `.panel-tabset`). Include a heading for each tab in the tabset.

For example, the following JavaScript code:

```` {.python .ojs-example}
::: {.panel-tabset}

## Plot

```{}
//| echo: false
vl
  .markPoint()    
  .data(penguins)
  .encode(
    vl.x().fieldQ('body_mass_g')
          .scale({domain: [2000, 6500]}) 
          .axis({title: "Mass (g)"}),
    vl.y().fieldQ('bill_length_mm')     
          .scale({domain: [30, 60]}),
    vl.color().fieldN('species'),
    vl.tooltip(['species', 'sex', 'year', 'island'])
).render()
```

## Data

```{}
//| echo: false
penguins.view()
```

:::
````

Will result in a tabset with **Plot** and **Data** tabs:

## Applications

Some documents are composed entirely of interactive components---these "documents" are really applications, and therefore benefit from some distinct layout tools.

### Full Page Layout

By default Quarto documents center their content within the document viewport, and don't exceed a maximum width of around 900 pixels. This behavior exists to optimize readability, but for an application layout you generally want to do occupy the entire page.

To do this, add tbe `page-layout: custom` option. For example:

``` yaml
format: 
  html:
    page-layout: custom
```

Here's an example of a Shiny application that occupies the full width of the browser:

![](shiny/images/iris-k-means.png){.border}

You'll also note that the inputs are contained within a sidebar---the next section describes how to create sidebars.

### Sidebar Panel

Sidebars are created using divs with class `.panel-sidebar`. You can do this using a markdown div container (as illustrated above for `.panel-input`), or, if the entire contents of your sidebar is created from a single code cell, by adding the `panel: sidebar` option to the cell. For example, here is the source code of the user-interface portion of the Shiny application displayed above:

```` python
---
title: "Iris K-Means Clustering"
format: 
  html:
    page-layout: custom
server: shiny
---

```{r}
#| panel: sidebar
vars <- setdiff(names(iris), "Species")
selectInput('xcol', 'X Variable', vars)
selectInput('ycol', 'Y Variable', vars, selected = vars[[2]])
numericInput('clusters', 'Cluster count', 3, min = 1, max = 9)
```

```{r}
#| panel: fill
plotOutput('plot1')
```
````

Note that the `panel: fill` option is added to the plot output chunk. You can alternately use `panel: center` if you want to leave some horiziontal margin around the contents of the panel.

#### Sidebar Div

In JavaScript interactive documents each input must be in it's own `{ojs}` cell, so you'll need to use the `.panel-sidebar` class on a div enclosing the inputs. For example, to create this layout:

You would use the following code:

### Panel Layout

```{=html}
<script type="application/javascript">
document.querySelectorAll(".ojs-example code > span")
  .forEach(function(span) { 
    if (span.innerText === "```{}")
      span.innerText = "```{ojs}";
  });
</script>
```
