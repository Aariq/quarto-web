## Overview

[Jupyter Widgets](https://jupyter.org/widgets) enable you to use JavaScript visualization libraries like [Leaflet](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), and [threejs](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs) directly from Python.

If you are uisng the Jupyter engine with Quarto this is a great way to incorporate interactivity without learning JavaScript.

## Usage

Including Jupyter Widgets within a Quarto document is as easy as including a plot. For example, here is how we embed a [Leaflet](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) map:

````{.python .python-example}
```{}
from ipyleaflet import Map, Marker, basemaps, basemap_to_tiles
m = Map(
  basemap=basemap_to_tiles(
    basemaps.NASAGIBS.ModisTerraTrueColorCR, "2017-04-08"
  ),
  center=(52.204793, 360.121558),
  zoom=4
)
m.add_layer(Marker(location=(52.204793, 360.121558)))
m
```
````

```{python}
#| echo: false
from ipyleaflet import Map, Marker, basemaps, basemap_to_tiles
m = Map(
  basemap=basemap_to_tiles(
    basemaps.NASAGIBS.ModisTerraTrueColorCR, "2017-04-08"
  ),
  center=(52.204793, 360.121558),
  zoom=4
)
m.add_layer(Marker(location=(52.204793, 360.121558)))
m
```
