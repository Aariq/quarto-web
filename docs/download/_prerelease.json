  "description": "## Jupyter Notebooks\n\n- Add support for embedding cell outputs in quarto documents using `{{< embed >}}`. You can address cells by Id, Tag, or label, such as `{{< embed mynotebook.ipynb#fig-output >}}` which would embed the output of a cell with the label `fig-output`). You can also provide a list of ids like `{{< embed mynotebook.ipynb#fig-output,tbl-out >}}`.\n- Only attempt to postprocess `text/plain` output if it's nonempty ([#3896](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3896)).\n- Fix output of bokeh plots so the right number of cells is generated ([#2107](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2107)).\n- Fix output of code cells that contain triple backticks (or more) ([#3179](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3179)).\n- Don't install SIGCHLD signal handler since it interferes with IJulia in Julia 1.8.4 and greater ([#2539](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2539)).\n\n## Code Annotation\n\n- Add support for annotation of code cells (executable or non-executable).

([#3003](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3003))\n- Add support for customizing the baseline widths of grid columns using yaml or scss. For more information, see [https://www.quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html](https://www.quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html).\n- Fix wrapping of long `code` entries inside table cells ([#3221](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3221))\n- Fix author display to use the `url` for an author even when there is no affiliation.\n- Add support for linking to other formats, when more than one format is produced. Alternate formats will appear with the TOC. Control using `format-links`.\n- Add support for linking to source notebooks that provide embedded content. Control using `notebook-links`\n- Improve callout wrapping behavior for long strings with no word breaks.\n- Add overflow to tables generated from SQL code cells ([#3497](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3497)).\n- Fix support for parquet files in OJS code cells ([#3630](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3630)).\n- Forward bootstrap table classes from caption to table element ([#4036](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4036)).\n- Render code listings with names and captions correctly ([#2195](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2195)).\n- Fix issue with interactivity of elements in mobile size dispay when `toc-left` is being used.

(#3296)\n\n## Websites\n\n- Fix issue assigning specific sidebar to a specific page using `sidebar:` (#3389)\n- Change behavior of `publish gh-pages` to always render into a clean directory.\n  Previous behavior was to add to existing contents of `gh-pages` branch. ([#3199](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3199), @ijlyttle)\n- Order sidebar entries using filename rather than title\n\n## Books\n\n- Remove chapter number of HTML head title when `number-sections` is `false` (#3304).\n- Non-HTML book output formats will now be placed in subdirectories (`book-<format>`) within the project output directory (`_books`)\n- Support for rendering to Asciidoc\n- Support for rendering to LaTeX\n\n## Preview\n\n- Correct redirect for VS Code Server (#3352) (Thank you, @benz0li!)\n\n## LUA\n\n- `quarto.version()` now returns `Version` object that simplifies comparison (thank you @tarleb)\n\n## HTML Output\n\n- HTML output will not decorate links within source code (for example, from `code-link: true`) with external icons.

See the [pre-release documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html) for details.\n- Replace default style for date picker component in OJS ([#2863](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2863)).\n- `quarto check` now supports `quarto check versions` for checking binary dependency versions in the case of custom binaries ([#3602](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3602)).\n- the API for shortcode handlers in lua now accepts a fourth parameter `raw_args` which hold the unparsed arguments in a table ([#3833](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3833)).\n- remove scaffolding div from conditional content in final output ([#3847](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3847)).\n- ensure proof titles are appended to paragraph nodes ([#3772](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3772)).\n- Support parsing markdown in table captions in LaTeX and HTML tables ([#2573](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2573)).\n- Improve parsing of include shortcodes ([#3159](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3159)).\n- Add support for Youtube privacy-enhanced urls in `video` shortcodes ([#4060](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4060)).\n- Don't emit empty cells ([#4034](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4034)).\n- Resolve link tags correctly in html dependencies ([#4304](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/4304)) (Thank you, @jdlom!).\n- use correct language code for Korean ([#4187](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/4187)).\n- resolve YAML options correctly for comments with open+close syntax ([#3901](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3901)).\n- Work around rare deno tempfile creation bug ([#4352](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/4352)).\n\n## Pandoc filter changes\n\n- Quarto 1.3 introduces the notion of Custom AST nodes to Pandoc filters.
