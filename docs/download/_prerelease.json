  "description": "## Jupyter Notebooks\n\n- Add support for embedding cell outputs in quarto documents using `{{< embed >}}`. You can address cells by Id, Tag, or label, such as `{{< embed mynotebook.ipynb#fig-output >}}` which would embed the output of a cell with the label `fig-output`). You can also provide a list of ids like `{{< embed mynotebook.ipynb#fig-output,tbl-out >}}`.\n- Only attempt to postprocess `text/plain` output if it's nonempty ([#3896](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3896)).\n- Fix output of bokeh plots so the right number of cells is generated ([#2107](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2107)).\n- Fix output of code cells that contain triple backticks (or more) ([#3179](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3179)).\n\n## Code Annotation\n\n- Add support for annotation of code cells (executable or non-executable). You can read more about code annotation at [https://www.quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html](https://www.quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html).\n\n## HTML Format\n\n- Improved handling of margin references that appear within a callout. ([#3003](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3003))\n- Add support for customizing the baseline widths of grid columns using yaml or scss. For more information, see [https://www.quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html](https://www.quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html).\n- Fix wrapping of long `code` entries inside table cells ([#3221](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3221))\n- Fix author display to use the `url` for an author even when there is no affiliation.\n- Add support for linking to other formats, when more than one format is produced. Alternate formats will appear with the TOC. Control using `format-links`.\n- Add support for linking to source notebooks that provide embedded content. Control using `notebook-links`\n- Improve callout wrapping behavior for long strings with no word breaks.\n- Add overflow to tables generated from SQL code cells ([#3497](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3497)).\n- Fix support for parquet files in OJS code cells ([#3630](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3630)).\n- Forward bootstrap table classes from caption to table element ([#4036](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4036)).\n- Render code listings with names and captions correctly ([#2195](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2195)).\n- Fix issue with interactivity of elements in mobile size dispay when `toc-left` is being used.

(#3059)\n\n## PDF Format\n\n- Fix wrong page number in the TOC for appendices ([#3164](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3164)) (Thank you, @iusgit!)\n- Add support for automatically converting SVG images to PDF ([#2575](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2575))\n- Previously, if the `pdf-engine` was set to `latexmk`, we would bypass many features of Quarto and use Pandoc to produce the PDF output. Starting in in Quarto 1.3, all Quarto features will be enabled for the `latexmk` engine and `latexmk` will be used to run the PDF generation loop.\n- Fix author processing in default PDFs for complex author names (#3483)\n- Remove excessive vertical space between theorem type blocks ([#3776](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3776)).\n- Fix temporary `.tex` filenames in the presence of multiple variants ([#3762](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3762)).\n  - Note that this fix changes the filenames used for PDF files with variants.

([#3059](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3059))\n\n## About Pages\n\n- Add support for `image-alt` which provides alternate text for the about page image. ([#3010](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3010))\n\n## Article Layout\n\n- Improve the performance of extremely large documents with margin elements by improving the efficiency of positioning the elements.\n\n## Listings\n\n- Listings now support `template-params`, which will be passed to custom EJS templates in a variable called `templateParams` when a listing is rendered.\n- Custom listing objects now resolve `path: ` fields into the metadata that would be generated by standard listings, giving custom listing access to computed metadata like `reading-time`, etc.\n- Improve support for `date-modified` in listings\n- Improve support for `yml` based listings by supporting usage of title and description from `yml`.\n- Allow listings in project to point directly to non-input files (such as `yml` files) to use for contents.\n- Allow `sort: false` to disable any sorting, allowing items to appear in their original / natural order. (#3296)\n\n## Websites\n\n- Fix issue assigning specific sidebar to a specific page using `sidebar:` (#3389)\n- Change behavior of `publish gh-pages` to always render into a clean directory.\n  Previous behavior was to add to existing contents of `gh-pages` branch. ([#3199](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3199), @ijlyttle)\n- Order sidebar entries using filename rather than title\n\n## Books\n\n- Remove chapter number of HTML head title when `number-sections` is `false` (#3304).\n\n## Preview\n\n- Correct redirect for VS Code Server (#3352) (Thank you, @benz0li!)\n\n## LUA\n\n- `quarto.version()` now returns `Version` object that simplifies comparison (thank you @tarleb)\n\n## HTML Output\n\n- HTML output will not decorate links within source code (for example, from `code-link: true`) with external icons. (#3755)\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n- Work around pandoc strict checking of `number-offset` type. ([#3126](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3126))\n- Warn instead of crash on bad URI ([#3220](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3220))\n- ensure `video` shortcode works with `embed-resources` and `self-contained` ([#3310](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3310))\n- Add optional `rel` attribute to navigation links ([#3212](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3212))\n- Use the right port when CRI is initialized multiple times ([#3066](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3066))\n- Allow custom themes for giscus ([#3105](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3105))\n- Add new `kbd` shortcode, to describe keyboard keys ([#3384](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3384)). See the [pre-release documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html) for details.\n- Replace default style for date picker component in OJS ([#2863](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2863)).\n- `quarto check` now supports `quarto check versions` for checking binary dependency versions in the case of custom binaries ([#3602](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3602)).\n- the API for shortcode handlers in lua now accepts a fourth parameter `raw_args` which hold the unparsed arguments in a table ([#3833](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3833)).\n- remove scaffolding div from conditional content in final output ([#3847](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3847)).\n- ensure proof titles are appended to paragraph nodes ([#3772](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3772)).\n- Support parsing markdown in table captions in LaTeX and HTML tables ([#2573](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2573)).\n- Improve parsing of include shortcodes ([#3159](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3159)).\n- Add support for Youtube privacy-enhanced urls in `video` shortcodes ([#4060](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4060)).\n- Don't emit empty cells ([#4034](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4034)).\n\n## Pandoc filter changes\n\n- Quarto 1.3 introduces the notion of Custom AST nodes to Pandoc filters.

In addition, it supports \"embedded Markdown content\" which will be resolved by quarto's processing, including shortcode and crossref resolution. See the [prerelease documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3.html) for more.\n\n## Project\n\n- fix rendering of individual project files to stdout ([#4052](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4052)).\n"
