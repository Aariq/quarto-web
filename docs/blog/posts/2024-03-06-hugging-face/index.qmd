We're happy to announce that you can now host Quarto Websites on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) using the new [Quarto Template](https://huggingface.co/new-space?template=posit%2Fquarto-template). This template allows you to deploy Quarto sites to Hugging Face with a click of a button, making it easy to integrate them with other Hugging Face models and datasets.

## About Hugging Face

Hugging Face is the most used open platform for AI, where the machine learning community has shared more than 500,000 models, 115,000 datasets, and 160,000 ML apps, including Stable Diffusion, Llama, GPT-J, and open-source ChatGPT alternatives.

These apps enable the community to explore models, replicate results, and lower the barrier of entry for ML. At Posit, we’ve been extremely impressed with the Hugging Face community and their commitment to supporting open-source machine learning models.

## What does Quarto add?

We think that Quarto is one of the best frameworks for scientific writing, making it a perfect tool for the Hugging Face community. With Quarto, you can interleave code and text to produce accurate, reproducible, and beautiful documents. You use simple markdown or Jupyter notebook files to generate [presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/), [manuscripts](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/), [dashboards](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/), and [more](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html).

## Conclusion

Our mission at Posit is to support open-source scientific software, and so we’re very proud to support Hugging Face's effort to build advanced AI models under open-source licenses. We can't wait to see what people build with this integration.
