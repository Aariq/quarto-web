## Caching

The [Knitr Cache](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/cache.html)  operates at the level of individual cells rather than the entire document. While this can be very convenient, it also introduced some special requirements around managing the dependencies between cells.

You can enable the Knitr cache at the document or project level using standard YAML options:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
format: html
execute: 
  cache: true
---
```

You can also enable caching on a per-cell basis (in this you would *not* set the document level option):

``` {{r}}
#| cache: true

summary(cars)
```

There are a variety of other cell-level options that affect Knitr caching behavior. You can learn about them in the Knitr [cell options](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html#cache) reference. Another excellent resource is Yihui Xie's article on [cache invalidation](https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/cache-invalidation/).
