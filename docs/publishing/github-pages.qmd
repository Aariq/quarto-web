## Overview

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a website hosting service that enables you to publish content based on source code managed within a GitHub repository.

There are two ways to publish Quarto websites and documents to GitHub Pages:

1.  Use the `quarto publish` command to publish content rendered on your local machine.

2.  Use a [GitHub Action] to automatically render your files (a single Quarto document or a Quarto project) and publish the resulting content whenever you push a source code change to your repository.

We'll cover each of these methods below, but first let's take care of some pre-requisites.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to have a Git repository on your local machine that is synced to GitHub. For a given repository, the URL of the published website will be derived from the combination of your username and the repository name (e.g. `https://username.github.io/reponame`).

You can optionally configure a [custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages) for a GitHub Pages site, but before exploring that ground you should get your site up and running with the default domain.

### User Site

In addition to creating sites tied to various repositories, you can also create a user site that is served from your root user domain (e.g. `https://username.github.io`). This is an ideal place to publish a blog or personal home page. To create a user site:

1.  Create a Git repo with the name `username.github.io` (where "username" is your GitHub username) and sync it to your local machine.

2.  Set the **Source** branch for your user site to `gh-pages`. For example:

    ![](images/gh-pages-user-site.png){.border}

Note that this step of explicitly setting the **Source** branch is only required for user sites (repository sites automatically use the `gh-pages` branch).

## Publish Command

The `quarto publish` command is an easy way to publish locally rendered documents and websites. From the directory where your project / git repository is located, execute the `quarto publish` command for GitHub Pages:

``` bash
quarto publish gh-pages
```

The publish command will confirm that you want to publish, render your content, copy the output to a special `gh-pages` branch, push that branch to GitHub, and then open a browser to view your site once it is deployed. You can customize this behavior by providing the following command line options:

{{< include _cli-options.md >}}

To publish a document rather than a website or book, provide the path to the document (note that you can publish only one document from a given GitHub repository):

``` bash
quarto publish gh-pages document.qmd
```

## GitHub Action

Once you've done this, check all of the newly created files (including the `_freeze` directory) into your repository and then push to GitHub. A GitHub Pages site will be created for your repository, and every time you push a new change to the repository it will be automatically rebuilt to reflect the change. Consult the **Pages** section of your repository **Settings** to see what the URL and publish status for your site is.
