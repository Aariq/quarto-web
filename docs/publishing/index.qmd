## Overview

There are a wide variety of ways to publish documents, presentations, and websites created using Quarto. This article walks though the various publishing destinations and methods available.

Quarto includes a [Publish Command] that makes publishing a website as simple as executing the `quarto publish` command from your project directory:

``` bash
quarto publish
```

Here are the publishing destinations supported by Quarto along with a brief description of when you might choose each.

| Destination                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| [Quarto Pub](https://quarto.pub/)                            | Publishing service for Quarto documents, websites, and books. Use Quarto Pub when you want a free, easy to use service for publicly available content.                                          |
| [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)                    | Publish content based on source code managed within a GitHub repository. Use GitHub Pages when the source code for your document or site is hosted on GitHub.                                   |
| [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) | Publishing platform for secure sharing of data products within an organization. Use RStudio Connect when you want to publish content within an organization rather than on the public internet. |
| [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)                          | Professional web publishing platform. Use Netlify when you want support for custom domains, authentication, previewing branches, and other more advanced capabilities.                          |
| [Other Services](other.qmd)                                  | Content rendered with Quarto uses standard formats (HTML, PDFs, MS Word, etc.) that can be published anywhere. Use this if one of the methods above don't meet your requirements.               |

For each destination you have the option of rendering and publishing locally using the [Publish Command] or using more [Advanced Publishing] workflows such as rendering on a continuous integration (CI) service.
