## Overview

Quarto supports the creation of custom formats that extend base formats like `pdf`, `html`, and `docx`. The custom format system is very flexible, and has been designed to accommodate the creation of articles for publishing in professional journals.

A major focus is single-source publishing: the same Quarto document source should be capable of producing both HTML and LaTeX output, and should also be capable of creating the LaTeX required for submission to multiple Journals. Key capabilities that enable this include:

-   The ability to flexibly adapt the native LaTeX templates provided by Journals for use with Pandoc.

-   The use of spans and divs to apply formatting (which enables targeting by CSS for HTML output and LaTeX macros/environments for PDF output).

-   A standardized schema for authors and affiliations so that you can express this data once and then have it automatically formatted according to the styles required for various Journals.

-   The use of Citation Style Language (CSL) to automate the formatting of citations and bibliographies according to whatever style is required by various Journals.
