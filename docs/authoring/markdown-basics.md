## Overview

Quarto is based on Pandoc and uses it's variation of markdown as it's underlying document syntax. Pandoc markdown is an extended and slightly revised version of John Gruber's [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.

Markdown is designed to be easy to write, and, even more importantly, easy to read:

> A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. -- [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy)

This document provides a high-level summary of the most commonly used markdown syntax. See the full documentation of [Pandoc's Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) for more in-depth documentation.
