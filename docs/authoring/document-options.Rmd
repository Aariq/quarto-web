Quarto supports a number of global document options that allow you to customize how documents are rendered (e.g. section numbering, table of contents, etc.). This article summarizes those options.

## Format

The most important option is the format to render to (e.g. HTML, PDF, etc.). This is specified using the `format` key. For example:

``` {.yaml}
format: pdf
```

You can also specify more than one format, as well as options that apply to only a given format. For example, here we provide some format-specific options:

``` {.yaml}
format:
  html:
    html-math-method: katex
  pdf:
    documentclass: report
```

```{r, child=c("_document-options-begin.Rmd", "_document-options-end.Rmd")}

```
