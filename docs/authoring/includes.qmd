## Overview

The `<include/>` directive is a is a convenient way to re-use content across documents. Includes work for plain markdown content as well as for `.qmd` files with executable code cells (note however that the cells must all use the same engine -- i.e. knitr or jupyter, but not both).

To include a file, add the `<include/>` tag at the location in your document where you want it included:

```markdown
<include file="_content.qmd"/>
```

Note that the include tag is closed with `/>` (to indicate that it has no content). Be sure to remember this when using includes!

## Content Includes

A concrete example would be if you have several articles about a topic that share a common introduction. Here we have an article titled "Revealjs Presentations" that wants to include some basic information on presentations not specific to Revealjs (we do that by including  `_basics.qmd`):

```markdown
---
title: "Revealjs Presentations"
---

## Overview

Revealjs Presentations are a great way to
present your ideas to others!

<include file="_basics.qmd"/>

## Revealjs Options

Note that we use an underscore (`_`) prefix for the included file. You should always use an underscore prefix with included files so that they are automatically ignored (i.e. not treated as standalone files) by a `quarto render` of a project).


## Computational Includes

You can also include files with computational cells. For example, here we include a `.qmd` that does some data preprocessing that we want shared across multiple documents:

```markdown
---
title: "My Document"
---

<include file="_data.qmd"/>
```

A couple of important things to remember when using computational includes:

1) All computations still share a single engine (e.g. knitr or jupyter)

2) Computational includes work only in `.qmd` files (they don't work in `.ipynb` notebook files)
