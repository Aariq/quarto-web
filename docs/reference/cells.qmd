title: "Code Cells"

## Overview

Cell options affect the execution and output of executable code blocks. They are specified within comments at the top of a block. For example:

```{{python}}
#| label: fig-polar
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

```

Unless noted otherwise, the options enumerated below are available for all execution engines (Jupyter, Knitr, and Observable). In addition, when using the Knitr engine you can specify any other valid [Knitr option](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#chunk-options).
