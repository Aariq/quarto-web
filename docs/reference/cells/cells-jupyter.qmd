title: "Code Cells: Jupyter"
---

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is an open document format that supports computations in many languages including Python, R, and Julia. Learn more about using Jupyter with Quarto in the article on [Running Code](../../computations/running-code.qmd).

## Overview

Cell options affect the execution and output of executable code blocks. They are specified within comments at the top of a block. For example:

``` {{python}}
#| label: fig-polar
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"
```
