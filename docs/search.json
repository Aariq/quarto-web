For example, PDF formats that enable creating articles using the LaTeX templates of various journals (much like the rticles suite of custom R Markdown formats)\n\n\nProject Format\nOutput formats for website or book Quarto Projects (both still under development).\n\n\nDocument Template\nPandoc templates and scaffold content for documents (e.g. to provide a common structure or look and feel across documents).\n\n\nDocument Filter\nPandoc Lua filters for low-level transformation of the Pandoc AST."
