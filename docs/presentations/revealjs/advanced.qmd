## Slide Transitions

Reveal supports a number of animated transition effects for both slide changes and slide background changes. By default no transitions are used, however you can enable them either globally or per-slide using the options described below.

Here are the available transition types:

| Transition | Description                                                            |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `none`     | No transition (switch instantly)                                       |
| `fade`     | Cross fade                                                             |
| `slide`    | Slide horizontally                                                     |
| `convex`   | Slide at a convex angle                                                |
| `concave`  | Slide at a concave angle                                               |
| `zoom`     | Scale the incoming slide so it grows in from the center of the screen. |

Here's how you would set the global transition style for both slides and backgrounds:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    transition: slide
    background-transition: fade
---
```

You can also specify the `transition-speed` as `default`, `fast`, or `slow`:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    transition: slide
    transition-speed: fast
---
```

You can also specify the `transition` and/or `transition-speed` for an individual slide:

``` markdown
## Slide Title {transition="fade" transition-speed="fast"}
```

You can also specify separate in and out transitions, for example:

``` markdown
## Slide Title {transition="fade-in slide-out"}
```

## Presentation Size

All presentations have a "normal" size, that is, the resolution at which they are authored. This default "normal" size is 1050 x 700, which is used to match as nearly as possible the aspect ratio of most laptops.

Reveal will automatically scale presentations uniformly based on the normal size to ensure that everything fits on any given display or viewport without changing the aspect ratio or layout of your content.

You can change the slide size, the margin around content, as well as set limits on content scaling using the following options:

| Option      | Description                                                                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `width`     | Normal width (defaults to 1050)                                                          |
| `height`    | Normal height (defaults to 700)                                                          |
| `margin`    | Factor of the display size that should remain empty around the content (defaults to 0.1) |
| `min-scale` | Smallest possible scale to apply to content (defaults to 0.2)                            |
| `max-scale` | Largest possible scale to apply to content (defaults to 2.0)                             |

## Content Layout

Reveal provides several helper classes for controlling the layout of content.

### Absolute Position

todo

### Stack Layout

The `r-stack` layout helper lets you center and place multiple elements on top of each other. This is intended to be used together with [fragments] to incrementally reveal elements. For example:

``` markdown
::: r-stack

::: fragment
![](https://placekitten.com/450/300){width="450" height="300"}
:::

::: fragment
![](https://placekitten.com/300/450){width="300" height="450"}
:::

::: fragment
![](https://placekitten.com/400/400){width="400" height="400"}
:::

:::
```

```{=html}
<iframe width="100%" src="demo/stack.html"></iframe>
```
## Preview Links

To open hyperlinks in an embedded iframe (convenient if you are presenting fullscreen and don't want the browser to exit the presentation) use the `preview-links` option:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    preview-links: true
---
```

You can also set this option on a per-link basis. These two links respectively enable and disable preview:

``` markdown
[Preview](https://example.com){preview-link="true"}

[NoPreview](https://example.com){preview-link="false"}
```

## Vertical Slides

Reveal uses classic linear slide navigation by default. If you wish you can also configure slide navigation to nest multiple slides within a single top-level slide to create a vertical stack.

Use the `navigation-mode` option to fine tune Reveal navigation behavior:

| Navigation Mode | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `linear`        | Left/right arrows step through all slides (both horizontal and vertical).                                                                                                 |
| `vertical`      | Left/right arrow keys step between horizontal slides. Up/down arrow keys step between vertical slides. Space key steps through all slides (both horizontal and vertical). |
| `grid`          | When this is enabled, stepping left/right from a vertical stack to an adjacent vertical stack will land you at the same vertical index.                                   |

If you use `vertical` or `grid` navigation, you should structure your slides using level 1 headings for the horizontal axis and level 2 headings for the vertical axis. For example:

``` markdown
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    navigation-mode: vertical
---

# Slide 1

## Slide 1.1

## Slide 1.2

# Slide 2

## Slide 2.1

## Slide 2.2
```

### Slide Controls

When you enable `vertical` or `grid` navigation, controls will appear to provide a visual cue to where you are in the presentation (e.g. if there are vertical slides below you'll see a down control).

By default these controls appear at the edges of the presentation, you can position them in the bottom right corner using the `controls-layout` option. You can also provide an extra visual cue to viewers that the controls are available using the `controls-tutorial` option. For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format: 
  revealjs:
    navigation-mode: vertical
    controls-layout: bottom-right
    controls-tutorial: true
---
```

Note that using `controls-layout: bottom-right` isn't compatible with including a `logo` (as the logo appears in the bottom right corner as well).

You can also disable the controls entirely with `controls: false`.

::: callout-warning
While vertical slides do provide some additional flexibility over the traditional linear model, they are in practice very confusing for end users (mostly because they are so unexpected). Users will often skip the vertical content because they simply don't know its there.

If your content benefits from vertical orientation (e.g. you have optional drill-down content that you don't want in the main flow of the presentation) by all means use the vertical mode. Just know that if you distribute your slides to users they will very likely not end up viewing any of the vertical content.

## Slide Visibility

You can hide a slide by adding the `visibility="hidden"` attribute to the slide heading. For example:

``` markdown
## Slide Title {visibility="hidden"}
```

### Uncounted Slides

When preparing a presentation it can sometimes be helpful to prepare optional slides that you may or may not have time to show. This is easily done by appending a few slides at the end of the presentation, however this means that the Reveal progress bar and slide numbering will hint that there are additional slides.

To "hide" those slides from then numbering system you can use `visibility="uncounted"`. For example:

``` markdown
## Slide 1

## Slide 2

## Slide 3 {visibility="uncounted"}
```

## Touch Navigation

You can swipe to navigate through a presentation on any touch-enabled device. Horizontal swipes change between horizontal slides, vertical swipes change between vertical slides.

If you wish to disable this you can set the `touch` option to `false`:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    touch: false
    controls: true
---
```

Note that we also enable `controls` at the same time (as users on phones or tablets don't have access to a keyboard).

## Reveal Plugins

To use [Revealjs plugins](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware), you need to package them into a directory with a config file (`plugin.yml`). The config file lets Quarto know how to inject the plugin into the presentation (e.g. what scripts and/or css files to include, what the default configuration should be, etc.).

See the source code of the plugins that are built in to Quarto Reveal for examples:

<https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/src/resources/formats/revealjs/plugins>

To use a plugin, just include a reference to its directory in the list of `plugins`. For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    plugins:
      - myplugin
---
```

Note that many of the most popular Reveal plugins are already included with the Quarto version of Reveal, so there is no need to include them separately. Built in plugins include:

-   [Multiplex](https://github.com/reveal/multiplex)
-   [RevealMenu](https://github.com/denehyg/reveal.js-menu)
-   [RevealChalkboard](https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/chalkboard)
-   [A11y](https://github.com/marcysutton/reveal-a11y) (accessibility)
-   [PdfExport](https://github.com/McShelby/reveal-pdfexport)
