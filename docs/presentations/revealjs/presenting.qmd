## Overview

This article covers the mechanics of presenting slides with Reveal. Basic navigation is done using the following keyboard shortcuts:

| Action                     | Keys                                       |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Next slide                 | <kbd>‚Üí</kbd> <kbd>SPACE</kbd> <kbd>N</kbd> |
| Previous slide             | <kbd>‚Üê</kbd> <kbd>P</kbd>                  |
| Navigate without fragments | <kbd>Alt ‚Üí</kbd> <kbd>Alt ‚Üê</kbd>          |
| Jump to first/last slide   | <kbd>Shift ‚Üí</kbd> <kbd>Shift ‚Üê</kbd>      |

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
You will often want to enter fullscreen mode when presenting. You can do this by pressing the <kbd>F</kbd> key.
:::

In addition to basic keyboard navigation, Reveal supports several more advanced capabilities, including:

-   Navigation menu and overview mode
-   Speaker view (w/ speaker notes)
-   Printing to PDF
-   Drawing on slides & chalkboard mode

These capabilities and others are described below.

## Navigation Menu

There is a navigation menu button <kbd>![](images/navigation-menu-icon.png){style="padding-bottom: 1px;" width="15" height="13"}</kbd> located in the bottom left corner of the presentation. Clicking the button opens a slide navigation menu that enables you to easily jump to any slide:

::: {layout="[4,4]"}
![](images/navigation-menu-button.png){.border}

![](images/navigation-menu-open.png){.border}
:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
You can also open the navigation menu by pressing the <kbd>M</kbd> key.
:::

The navigation menu also includes a **Tools** pane that provides access to the various other navigation tools including Fullscreen, Speaker View, Overview Mode, and Print to PDF.

## Overview Mode

Overview mode provides an alternate view that shows you a thumbnail for each slide:

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
You can enable Overview Mode by pressing the <kbd>O</kbd> key.
:::

## Speaker View

The speaker view shows the current slide along with the upcoming slide, a timer, and any speaker notes associated with the current slide:

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
You can enable Speaker View by pressing the <kbd>S</kbd> key.
:::

You can add speaker notes to a slide using a div with class `.notes`. For example:

``` markdown
## Slide with speaker notes

Slide content

::: {.notes}
Speaker notes go here.
:::
```

## Print to PDF

Reveal presentations can be exported to PDF via a special print stylesheet.

::: callout-note
Note: This feature has only been confirmed to work in [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome) and [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home).
:::

To Print to PDF, do the following:

1.  Toggle into Print View using the <kbd>E</kbd> key (or using the [Navigation Menu])
2.  Open the in-browser print dialog (CTRL/CMD+P).
3.  Change the **Destination** setting to **Save as PDF**.
4.  Change the **Layout** to **Landscape**.
5.  Change the **Margins** to **None**.
6.  Enable the **Background graphics** option.
7.  Click **Save** üéâ

Here's what the Chrome print dialog would look like with these settings enabled:

### Print Options

There are a number of options that affected printed output that you may want to configure prior to printing:

| Option                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `show-notes`              | Include speaker notes (`true`, `false`, or `separate-page)`                                                                                                                          |
| `slide-number`            | Include slide numbers (`true` or `false`)                                                                                                                                            |
| `pdf-max-pages-per-slide` | Slides that are too tall to fit within a single page will expand onto multiple pages. You can limit how many pages a slide may expand to using the `pdf-max-pages-per-slide` option. |
| `pdf-separate-fragments`  | Slides with multiple fragments are printed on a single page by default. To create a page for each fragment set this option to `true`.                                                |

For example, the following specifies that we want to print speaker notes on their own page and include slide numbers:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    show-notes: separate-page
    slide-number: true
---
```

## Navigation Options

There are several navigational cues provided as part of Reveal presentations and corresponding options that control them:

| Option         | Description                                                                                                                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `progress`     | Show a progress bar at the bottom (defaults to `true`)                                                                               |
| `slide-number` | Show the current slide number (defaults to `false`)                                                                                  |
| `history`      | Push slide changes to the browser history. When this is `true` the browser Forward/Back buttons can be used for slide navigation.    |
| `hash-type`    | Type of URL hash to use for slides. Defaults to `id` which uses an `id` derived from the slide title. You can also specify `number`. |

For example, the following configuration hides the progress bar and adds slide numbers:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    progress: false
    slide-number: true
---
```
