### Overview

Quarto supports executable code blocks within markdown.
This allows you to create fully reproducible documents and reports---the code required to produce your output is part of the document itself, and is automatically re-run whenever the document is rendered.

In this tutorial we'll show you how to author fully reproducible computational documents with Quarto in RStudio.

### Controlling output

-   echo, warning, include, error
-   fenced-echo go here? If you ever had to teach... https://quarto.org/docs/computations/running-code.html#fenced-echo

### Code blocks

-   code-fold
-   code-line-numbers (also used for highlighting)

### Figures

-   fig-width and fig-height
-   fig-cap (can you do referencing from here??)
-   fig-alt (link to writing good alt text resource)

### Tables

Maybe a gt example would look nice and can show caption?

### Inline code

https://quarto.org/docs/computations/running-code.html#knitr

### Caching

-   under `execute` in YAML
-   or chunk by chunk
-   link to https://yihui.org/knitr/demo/cache/ for more info

### Global options?

-   maybe mention here?
