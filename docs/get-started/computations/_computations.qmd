This dataset contains a subset of the fuel economy data from the EPA.
Specifically, we use the `mpg` dataset from the **ggplot2** package.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| echo: false

library(ggplot2)
```

The plots in Figure @fig-mpg show the relationship between city and highway mileage for 38 popular models of cars.
In Figure @fig-mpg-1 the points are colored by the number of cylinders while in Figure @fig-mpg-2 the points are colored by engine displacement.

```{r}
#| label: fig-mpg
#| fig-cap: "City and highway mileage for 38 popular models of cars."
#| fig-subcap:
#|   - "Color by number of cylinders"
#|   - "Color by engine displacement, in liters"
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page
