### Overview

In this tutorial we'll show you how to author Quarto documents in RStudio.
In particular, we'll discuss the various document formats you can produce with the same source code and show you how to add components like table of contents, equations, citations, etc.
The [visual markdown editor](/docs/visual-editor/) in RStudio makes many of these tasks easier so we'll highlight its use in this tutorial, but note that it's possible to accomplish these tasks in the source editor as well.

### Formats

-   by default it's html
-   but you can also do PDF or MS Word by changing the `format` in YAML
-   In html some things to highlight are `code-fold`, `code-link` , tabsets, publish to rpubs or ghpages or look at other options at https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-publishing.html
-   In pdf, `documentclass`, `geometry`, `colorlinks`
-   Also possible to do Word, but don't say much more
-   Also can do presentations! Link to presentations on the guide.

### Table of contents

https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#table-of-contents and https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html#table-of-contents -- show the yaml is pretty much the same

### Section numbering

### Equations

Basically first screenshot from https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html#equations but in qmd

### Citations

Screenshot / GIF: Show insert citation from DOI using the visual editor

Mention it creates bib for you and adds to it

Mention can link Zotero etc.
