## Overview

[Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) is a publishing platform for supporting team collaboration. There are a variety of hosting options which include both free and paid subscription plans.

It's important to note that some documents and sites published to Confluence are **publicly visible**. You should ensure that you only publish content you wish to share publicly to your public Confluence pages.

The best way to publish content to Confluence is to use the `quarto publish` command to publish content rendered on your local machine.

Before attempting your first publish, be sure that you have created a [free Confluence account](https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=confluence&edition=free) or are [logged into your organization's account](https://start.atlassian.com/).

Learn more about Confluence publishing in the Quarto Guide's [page on Confluence](../../publishing/confluence.qmd).
