## Overview

Starting in Quarto 1.3, HTML pages (either standalone or in a website) automatically include links to other formats specified in the document front matter. The additional formats will be automatically placed within the TOC as a new section, if a TOC is enabled for the page. If no TOC is displayed, the additional formats will be displayed in the right margin at the top of the document.

For example, the following document front matter:

``` yaml
title: Sample Page
author: Norah Jones
date: last-modified
toc: true
format: 
  html: default
  ipynb: default
```

Now results in an HTML page which includes the additional notebook format as a part of the TOC region:

## Other Format Links

Links to additional formats are displayed by default in Quarto HTML documents, but you can control whether they are shown or even which specific formats are included.

You can provide an explicit list of formats to include in the `Other Formats` section by providing a list as the value for `format-links`. For example, this document front matter will display only the link to the Jupyter format of the document, excluding the PDF:

``` yaml
title: Sample Page
author: Norah Jones
date: last-modified
toc: true
format: 
  html: default
  ipynb: default
  pdf: default
format-links: [ipynb]
```

## Hiding Format Links

To stop the other format links from being shown at all, specify `format-links: false` in your document front matter. For example this front matter will not display the 'Other Formats' links:

``` yaml
title: Sample Page
author: Norah Jones
date: last-modified
toc: true
format: 
  html: default
  ipynb: default
format-links: false
```

In a Quarto Project, you can use `_metadata.yml`{spellcheck="false"} to control the behavior for a specific folder. Just include the `format`{spellcheck="false"} and `format-links`{spellcheck="false"} options in a `_metadata.yml`{spellcheck="false"} file to apply the options to all files in a folder. See [Directory Metadata](/docs/projects/quarto-projects.qmd#directory-metadata) for additional details.
