In Quarto 1.3, callouts are represented as a custom AST node.
In Lua filters, callouts are represented as a table with the following fields:

- `type`: the type of callout: `note`, `caution`, `warning`, etc.
- `caption`: The callout caption (if any)
- `icon`: the callout icon (or `false` if none)
- `appearance`: `"minimal"`, `"simple"`, or `"default"`
- `div`: a pandoc div containing the callout content
