## Introduction

The [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/py/) package provides an easy way to build web applications with Python. Quarto documents can also now include embedded Shiny components (e.g. a plot with sliders that control its inputs) or even simple Shiny applications that include several components.

This section covers integrating Shiny with Quarto and assumes that you already have basic familiarity with Shiny. To learn more about Shiny please visit <https://shiny.posit.co/py/>.

## Hello, Shiny

Here's a simple example that illustrates embedding Shiny components within a Quarto document:

![](images/hello.png){.border}

Here's the source code for this example (click the numbered annotations on the right for additional explanation):

````{.python}
---
title: "Penguin Flipper Length"
format: html
server: shiny  # <1>
---

```{{python}}
import seaborn as sns
from shiny import render, reactive, ui
penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins")
```

```{{python}}
#| panel: input  # <2>
ui.input_slider("bins", "Number of bins:", 5, 15, 10)
```

```{{python}}
@render.plot  # <3>
def histogram(): # <3>
    sns.histplot(data = penguins, x ="flipper_length_mm", # <3>
                 bins=input.bins()) # <3>
```
````

1. The main difference between this document and a normal static document is the inclusion of `server: shiny` within the document's options, which instructs Quarto to run a Shiny process behind the document:


2. We use the `panel: input` cell option to provide visual separation for inputs. The plot rendering code in the next cell uses normal Shiny reactive output syntax.

3. To render reactive content within Shiny documents you implement a function that returns the content and annotate it with a render decorator (in this case `@render.plot`).

If you want to try running this example now, paste the `hello.qmd` code from above into a Quarto document within VS Code and execute the **Preview** command:

![](images/hello-vscode.png){.border}

Note that while there are some integrated tools available within VS Code, you can use any editor you like for developing Shiny interactive documents. See the [Running Documents](running.qmd) for details on running from the command line, debugging, deployment, etc.

## Sidebar Layout

Here's an example that includes multiple inputs as well as a more application-like page layout with a sidebar:

![](images/custom.png){.border}

Here's the source code for this example:

````python
---
title: "Penguin Bills"
format: html
page-layout: full  # <1>
server: shiny
---

```{{python}}
import seaborn as sns
from shiny import render, reactive, ui
penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins")
```

```{{python}}
#| panel: sidebar  # <2>
ui.input_select("x", "Variable:", 
                choices=["bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm"])
ui.input_select("dist", "Distribution:", choices=["hist", "kde"])
ui.input_checkbox("rug", "Show rug marks", value = False)
```

```{{python}}
#| panel: fill  # <3>
@render.plot
def displot():
    sns.displot(
        data=penguins, hue="species", multiple="stack",
        x=input.x(), rug=input.rug(),kind=input.dist())
```
````

1.  The YAML front-matter includes the `page-layout: full` option (to indicate we want our content to occupy the entire page rather than being centered with padding).

2.  We use `panel: sidebar` to group inputs in a sidebar to the left of the content display.

3. We use `panel: fill` to ensure that the content occupies all of the page to the right of the sidebar.


## Learning More

To learn more about Shiny for Python interactive documents see the following articles:

-   [Running Documents](running.qmd) covers how to run interactive documents both within VS Code and at the command line, as well as how to deploy them to end users.

-   [Execution Contexts](execution.qmd) goes in depth on when different code cells run (e.g. rendering vs. serving).

-   [Component Layout](/docs/interactive/layout.qmd) enumerates the various techniques you can use to layout interactive components within your documents.

-   [Shiny for Python](https://shiny.posit.co/py/) provides in-depth documentation on all of the available UI and ouput widgets, as well as conceptual discussions on how things work.
