### Shiny Prerequisites

In order to use Shiny within Quarto documents you will need both the latest pre-release of Quarto as well as development versions of the `htmltools` and `shiny` Python packages. You can install these packages as follows:

```bash
# Optional: If you have installed shiny and/or htmltools
# previously, uninstall them before proceeding:
pip uninstall shiny htmltools

pip install git+https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny.git#egg=shiny
```
