title: "Typst Format"
---

Quarto v1.4 includes support for the `typst` output format. [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) is a new open-source markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use. Typst creates beautiful PDF output with blazing fast render times.

## Getting Started

To try out the `typst` format:

1.  Download and install the very latest version of the [Typst CLI](https://github.com/typst/typst#installation).

2.  Create a document that uses `format: typst`. For example:

    ``` yaml
    ---
    title: "My document"
    format: typst
    ---

    Hello, typst!
    ```

Rendering or previewing this document will invoke the Typst CLI to create a PDF from your markdown source file.

## Typst Options

The following options are available for `typst` documents:

| Option                | Description                                                                                                                                                |

## Raw Blocks

If you want to use raw `typst` markup, use a raw `typst` block. For example:

````default
```{=typst} 
#set par(justify: true)

== Background 
In the case of glaciers, fluid dynamics principles can be used to understand how the movement and behavior of the ice is influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of other fluids (such as water).
```
````

To learn more about `typst` markup, see the tutorial here: <https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/>.

## Known Limitations

-   Cross references are supported for figures, sections, and equations (but not subfigures, tables ,or theorems as these aren't yet supported in `typst`)
-   Callouts are not yet supported (they become block quotes with a bold heading)
-   Figure panels/layout are not currently supported.
-   Advanced page layout (panel layout, margin layout, etc.) does not work
-   Various other small things might not yet be implemented, please let us know if you see things that could use improvement!
