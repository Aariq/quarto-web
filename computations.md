## Overview

Quarto supports embedding computations within markdown. This allows you to create fully reproducible documents and reports---the code required to produce your output is part of the document itself, and is automatically re-run whenever the document is rendered.

There are currently two engines supported for running computations:

-   [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), for embedding code from Python, Julia, and many other languages.

-   [Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/), for embedding code from R.

Extensive customization of code chunk output is supported, including the ability to hide code and/or output as well as fold code (make it visible only on demand).

### Simple Examples

Here are a couple of simple examples in Python and R to illustrate. In both cases the plot generated by the code will be embedded in the document when it is rendered:

#### Python

```` {.markdown}
---
title: "My Document"
---

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,2,3,4])
plt.show()
```

```{python}
import pandas as pd
d = {'one' : [1., 2., 3., 4.],
     'two' : [4., 3., 2., 1.]}
df = pd.DataFrame(d)
df
```
````

#### R

```` {.markdown}
---
title: "My Document"
---

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
        geom_point() + 
        geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
summary(airquality)
```
````

Note that these code blocks use braces around the language name (e.g. ```` ```{python} ````). This is what indicates that the code chunk is executable and should be run by Quarto during render. Code chunks that use no braces (e.g. ```` ```python ````) are not run.

You can produce a wide variety of output types from code chunks, including:

-   Static plots (e.g. from matplotlib or ggplot2).

-   Interactive plots (e.g. from plotly or leaflet).

-   Tabular output (e.g. from printing R or Pandas data frames)

-   Plain text output (e.g. printing the results of statistical summaries).

### Supported Formats

Quarto will run computations in any markdown document that uses `{}` delimited language names in it's code chunks. The engine used for computations is automatically determined based on the language(s) used in the document (see [Engine Binding](#engine-binding) below for details on how to override this). For example, the documents shown above might be rendered with:

``` {.bash}
$ quarto render py-example.md
$ quarto render r-example.md
```

Quarto is also highly compatible with existing formats used for computational documents. You can render any Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) or R Markdown document (.Rmd) with Quarto, and use all of the same computational features described here:

``` {.bash}
$ quarto render py-example.ipynb
$ quarto render r-example.Rmd
```

Note that R users will likely want to continue using the .Rmd extension for Quarto, as the Quarto format is backwards compatible with .Rmd and editors (e.g. RStudio) will make features like interactive chunk execution available when the .Rmd extension is present.

Jupyter users have a choice of authoring in .ipynb (.e.g. using the JupyterLab or VS Code notebook editor) or authoring in plain text using their favorite text editor. See the article on [Authoring Tools](authoring-tools.md) for additional details.

## Output Options

There are a wide variety of options available for customizing computational output. All of these options can be specified either globally (in the document front-matter) or per code-block. For example, here's a modification of the Python example to specify that we don't want to "echo" the code into the output document:

``` {.markdown}
---
title: "My Document"
execute:
  echo: false
---
```

Note that we can override this option on a per code-block basis. For example:

```` {.markdown}
```{python}
#| echo: true

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,2,3,4])
plt.show()
```
````

Code block options are included in a special comment at the top of the block (lines at the top prefaced with `#|` are considered options).

Options available for customizing output include:

| Option    | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `eval`    | Evaluate the code chunk (if `false`, just echos the code into the output).                                                                   |
| `echo`    | Include the source code in output                                                                                                            |
| `output`  | Include the results of executing the code in the output                                                                                      |
| `warning` | Include warnings in the output.                                                                                                              |
| `error`   | Include errors in the output (note that this implies that errors executing code will not halt processing of the document).                   |
| `include` | Catch all for preventing any output (code or results) from being included (e.g. `include: false` suppresses all output from the code block). |

Here's our original R example with some of these additional options:

```` {.markdown}
---
title: "My Document"
execute:
  echo: false
  warning: false
---

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
        geom_point() + 
        geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
summary(airquality)
```
````

## Execution Options

While it's extremely convenient to embed computations within documents, it can present problems if code blocks are long running. There are a couple of built-in ways to mitigate expensive computations.

### Caching 

Quarto integrates with the [Jupyter Cache](https://jupyter-cache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).) and [Knitr Cache](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/cache.html)) to to cache time consuming code chunks. Note that to use Jupyter Cache you'll want to install the `jupyter-cache` package:

``` {.bash}
$ pip install jupyter-cache
```

To enable caching for a document just add the `cache` option:

``` {.markdown}
execute: 
  cache: true
```

You can also use \`quarto\` command line options to control caching behavior without changing the document's code. Use options to force the use of caching on all chunks, disable the use of caching on all chunks (even if it's specified in options), or to force a refresh of the cache even if it has not been invalidated:

``` {.bash}
$ quarto render example.md --cache 
$ quarto render example.md --no-cache 
$ quarto render example.md --cache-refresh 
```

Note that for Jupyter, the cache for a document is invalidated if any of the code blocks change. For Knitr, invalidation occurs on a per-cell basis.

### Disabling Execution

In some cases, you may want to prevent execution entirely. This is especially useful if you author using a standard notebook editor (e.g. JupyterLab) and plan on executing chunks only within the notebook UI. Specify `execute: false` to skip execution when rendering (you'll naturally still get the output that was generated within the notebook editor):

``` {.markdown}
execute: false
```

You might also set this option if you just want to preview markdown content without re-running computation.

## Engine Binding

Earlier we said that the engine used for computations was determined automatically. You may want to customize this---for example you may want to use the Jupyter [R kernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel)rather than Knitr, or you may want to use Knitr with Python code (via [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)).

Here are the basic rules for automatic binding:

+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| File Type               | Engine Binding                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|                         | Uses Jupyter engine if an executable code block (e.g. `{python}`) is discovered within the file. The kernel used is determined based on the language of the first executable code block discovered in the file. |
+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

You can override the engine used via the `engine` option. For example:

``` {.markdown}
execute:
  engine: jupyter
  
execute:
  engine: knitr
```

You can also specify that no engine should be used via `engine: none`.

The presence of the `knitr` or `jupyter` option will also override the default engine:

``` {.markdown}
knitr: true

jupyter: python3
```

Variations with additional engine-specific options also work to override the default engine:

``` {.markdown}
knitr:
  opts_knit:
    verbose: true
    
jupyter:
  kernelspec:
    display_name: Python 3
    language: python
    name: python3
```
