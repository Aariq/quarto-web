## Installing Quarto

``` include
docs/download/_download.md
```

The article on [Installation](docs/getting-started/installation.html) includes additional details on installing optional dependencies (e.g. for computational documents with Python and/or R). In many cases you'll already have these dependencies installed (e.g. Jupyter) so need not installing anything more than the Quarto CLI to get started.

## Learning Quarto

[Quarto Basics](docs/getting-started/quarto-basics.qmd) will help you learn the core mechanics of rendering markdown as well as how to specify document formats and options.

[Running Code](docs/computations/running-code.qmd) explains how to work with Jupyter and Knitr based computational documents in more depth.

[JupyterLab](docs/tools/jupyter-lab.qmd), [RStudio](docs/tools/rstudio.qmd), and [VS Code](docs/tools/vscode.qmd) help you create an optimal workflow in your code editing tool(s) of choice.

[Visual Editor](docs/visual-editor/) describes how to use Quarto's visual interface for composing long-form markdown documents.

[Gallery](docs/gallery/) provides examples of articles, reports, presentations, interactive documents, websites, and books using various formats.
